"""Import-linter contract tests.

Two contracts:

1. The shipping `.importlinter` config is in good shape:
   `lint-imports` exits 0 on the current tree.

2. An intentional cross-layer import injected into a temporary tree fails
   the contract — i.e. the contracts actually catch what they claim to
   catch. This is the load-bearing regression case for architectural
   boundary enforcement.

The injection test runs `lint-imports` against a temporary copy of the
repository with one extra import added; it does NOT mutate the live tree.
