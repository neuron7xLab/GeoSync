"""T15 — OMS idempotency and lifecycle causality witnesses.

Covers two OMS invariants that have concrete surface in the production
``execution.oms.OrderManagementSystem``:

* **INV-OMS2 — idempotency**: submitting the same ``correlation_id``
  more than once must not double-book the position. The OMS's internal
  ``_processed`` map dedupes correlation IDs, so a second submit with
  the same key is a no-op after the first fill.

* **INV-OMS3 — causal order**: lifecycle events for a single order
  appear in strictly non-decreasing causal order — SUBMIT must precede
  ACK, ACK must precede any FILL, FILL events are totally ordered, and
  a CANCEL never precedes the SUBMIT it cancels.

The fixture is a minimal, deterministic clone of the pattern used by
``tests/unit/execution/test_oms_lifecycle.py``: a stub risk controller,
a deterministic in-memory connector, and an in-memory sqlite-backed
``OrderLifecycleStore``. No network, no disk persistence (auto_persist
disabled), single-threaded.
