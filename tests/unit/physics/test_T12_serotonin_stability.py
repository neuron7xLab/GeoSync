"""T12 — Serotonin stability witnesses for INV-5HT1, INV-5HT4 and INV-5HT6.

Three independent invariants on the serotonin subsystem, all P0:

* **INV-5HT1** — Lyapunov non-increasing. The 2-state 5-HT ODE in
  ``core.neuro.serotonin_ode`` is equipped with a documented Lyapunov
  function V(level, desens) = ½(level − target)² + λ·desens². With
  stress = 0 (zero exogenous forcing), V is non-increasing along the
  RK4 trajectory. The witness runs a 200-step trajectory from a
  perturbed initial state and asserts V never rises.

* **INV-5HT4** — desensitisation sensitivity stays in [0.1, 1.0] across
  any sequence of (stress, drawdown, novelty) inputs to the production
  ``SerotoninController``. Covered by a 50-step stochastic sweep.

* **INV-5HT6** — tonic_level finite and non-negative under the same
  sweep. Combined with INV-5HT4 into the single-loop witness to keep
  the sweep efficient while exercising both bounds on every step.
