"""T24 — Witness tests for ``core.kuramoto.metrics`` public helpers.

The module exposes four pure observables that every downstream
consumer relies on:

* ``order_parameter``        — global Kuramoto coherence R(t) (INV-K1).
* ``chimera_index``          — neighbourhood variance of local R_i(t).
* ``rolling_csd``            — causal rolling variance and lag-1 AC
                               of R(t) (determinism-critical signal).
* ``permutation_entropy``    — normalised Bandt-Pompe entropy in [0, 1].

Existing physics tests only touch ``compute_metrics`` once through the
full pipeline (see ``test_T23_ott_antonsen_chimera.py``). The individual
helpers have never been exercised as witnesses — that means regressions
in the definitional bounds (R ≤ 1, permutation entropy ≤ 1, finite
outputs) would slip past CI.

This file closes the gap with:

1. **Hypothesis property sweep** of ``order_parameter`` over arbitrary
   finite phase matrices to witness the universal bound R ∈ [0, 1]
   (INV-K1). Tolerance: the only float-rounding floor that can leak
   below zero is ``|z| = sqrt(a**2 + b**2)`` with ``a, b`` finite; the
   bound is analytically ≥ 0 so the tolerance is 0.0 (exact).
2. **Falsification input** for INV-K1: ``phases = θ * 2`` — scaling a
   valid wrapped phase by 2 does *not* break the bound (exp(i·2θ) is
   still on the unit circle), but an arbitrary *non-circular* linear
   transform must eventually produce R > 1 or R < 0 — we witness that
   the helper refuses to inflate R beyond 1 even on extreme inputs.
3. **Determinism witness** for ``permutation_entropy`` — INV-SB2:
   repeated calls on an identical series are bit-identical. The
   falsification input is a fresh RNG permutation of the same series,
   which must produce a *different* entropy (patterns are reshuffled).
4. **Numerical-stability witness** for ``chimera_index`` on a
   disconnected graph (all-zero adjacency) — INV-HPC2: the zero-row
   safeguard must keep output finite rather than emit NaN/Inf.
5. **Rolling CSD** input-validation witness — window outside [2, T]
   must raise ``ValueError`` (INV-HPC2: contract edge).
