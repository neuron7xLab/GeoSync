"""T9 — Kuramoto sub/supercritical witnesses for INV-K2 and INV-K3.

The Kuramoto mean-field transition at K = K_c = 2/(π·g(0)) is the
single most important falsification target in this stack. A working
engine must land on the two asymptotic predictions simultaneously:

* **INV-K2 — subcritical decay**: for K well below K_c, the order
  parameter settles at the finite-size noise floor, bounded by
  ε = C/√N with C ∈ [2, 3] (the tolerance comes straight out of the
  catalog's ``epsilon`` parameter for INV-K2).

* **INV-K3 — supercritical order**: for K well above K_c, the order
  parameter stabilises at R∞ > 0 and the trajectory's standard
  deviation in the late-time window is small relative to its mean,
  i.e. the system actually reached a synchronised steady state.

Both witnesses call the production ``core.kuramoto.engine.KuramotoEngine``
over a 15-second integration window (dt=0.01, steps=1500) with a seeded
Gaussian frequency distribution so the tests are deterministic across
runs and platforms. K_c is computed analytically from the Gaussian
density (never hard-coded) so the witness also traps regressions in the
critical-coupling constant.
