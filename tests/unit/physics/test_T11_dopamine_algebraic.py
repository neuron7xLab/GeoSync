"""T11 — Dopamine TD-error witnesses for INV-DA1 and INV-DA7.

The dopamine controller in ``geosync.core.neuro.dopamine.dopamine_controller``
exposes ``compute_rpe(reward, value, next_value, discount_gamma)`` which
implements the canonical TD(0) prediction error:

    δ = r + γ · V(s') − V(s)

Two invariants follow directly from this algebraic form:

* **INV-DA1 — sign directionality**: δ > 0 when the observed reward
  exceeds the prediction (positive surprise), δ < 0 when it falls short
  (negative surprise), δ ≈ 0 when reward matches the prediction. The
  sign reflects the surprise direction.

* **INV-DA7 — linearity in reward**: ∂δ/∂r = 1 exactly. Equivalently,
  δ(r₂) − δ(r₁) = r₂ − r₁ for any fixed (V, V', γ). This is an
  algebraic identity and must hold to double-precision on the exact
  closed-form TD update.

The witnesses call the production ``compute_rpe`` with a live
controller loaded from ``config/dopamine.yaml`` so any regression in
the TD-error path surfaces here.
