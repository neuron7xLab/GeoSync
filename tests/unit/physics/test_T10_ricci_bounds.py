"""T10 — Ollivier–Ricci curvature bound witnesses for INV-RC1 and INV-RC3.

The production implementation in ``core.indicators.ricci`` computes
κ = 1 − W₁(m_x, m_y)/d(x, y) using a 1-D positional embedding (integer
node IDs, unit spacing by default) and an α = 1/(deg+1) lazy random
walk. Under this choice, two distinct universal bounds hold:

* **INV-RC1 — upper bound (universal)**: κ ≤ 1 for every edge of every
  connected graph. This follows from W₁ ≥ 0 alone and is independent
  of topology or walk laziness.

* **INV-RC3 — full interval on price graphs**: κ ∈ [−1, 1] for every
  edge produced by ``build_price_graph``. The tighter lower bound
  holds because consecutive integer node IDs make the 1-D embedding
  distance match the combinatorial graph distance on every edge, so
  the standard Ollivier theorem recovers its full [−1, 1] guarantee.

Note: the earlier statement of INV-RC1 in INVARIANTS.yaml claimed
κ ∈ [−1, 1] universally. This witness, on a cycle_12 graph, falsified
that statement (κ = −2 on adjacent nodes separated by 9 in the integer
embedding). The YAML has been corrected to split the universal upper
bound (INV-RC1) from the scoped two-sided bound (INV-RC3), and this
file now carries both witnesses.
