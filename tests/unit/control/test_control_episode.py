"""Unit tests for ``geosync_hpc.control.control_episode``.

Falsifier probes (each test references the invariant it defends):

    Probe A: Strip the state-machine ordering check.
             -> tests 4, 7, 9, 13, 17, 18
    Probe B: Allow seq to repeat or decrease.
             -> tests 2, 21
    Probe C: Replace sha256 with a constant or weaken the chain link.
             -> tests 23, 24, 25
    Probe D: Allow phase replay on a closed episode.
             -> test 20
    Probe E: Re-introduce ``created_before_action`` / ``prior_confidence``
             / ``reentry_threshold`` field laundering.
             -> test 29
    Probe F: Pull a forbidden runtime import (trading, execution, ...).
             -> test 30
    Probe G: Skip running the comparator at ERROR_COMPUTED.
             -> tests 14, 15, 16
