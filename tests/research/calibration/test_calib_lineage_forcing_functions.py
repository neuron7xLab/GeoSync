"""Architectural forcing functions for the CALIB-GRID lineage family.

The prior structural audit (#759) deduped the *instances* of the
fractal data-structure duplication. This module attacks the surviving
*generative mechanism*: the CALIB-GRID lineage tree has no architectural
forcing function, so each new lineage can legally re-derive a frozen-sha
literal, a bespoke ledger schema, or its own divergent numeric-tolerance
window ad hoc. #759's ``test_substrate_is_single_source`` only guards the
four already-named primitives (``hashlib.sha256`` inline, the gate
dataclass, ``_branch_sha``, ``_topology_f1``); it does **not** prevent a
hypothetical lineage #6 from bolting on a new bespoke provenance literal,
a new RESULTS schema, or a third copy of ``_deep_close`` with a wider
tolerance.

These tests are the missing negative-feedback term. They are strictly
pure-additive (no frozen artifact, pre-registration, gate, threshold,
seed, σ, θ₀ or decision rule is touched, and the protected
``test_grid_kuramoto.py`` is unmodified). Each one fails closed the
moment a future lineage re-derives — rather than inherits — a property
the family must share:

* ``test_no_frozen_sha_literal_outside_substrate_registry`` — kills the
  scale-invariant "re-paste the provenance hash" generator (F1/F5):
  every 40/64-hex provenance literal must live only in
  ``_substrate`` (the registry) or in a test asserting the registry's
  value. A lineage #6 that hard-codes ``CG003_PREREG_SHA = "…"`` in its
  own module fails this test.
* ``test_deep_close_tolerance_is_pinned_single_valued_and_sharp`` —
  kills the monotonic tolerance-creep generator (F3): the two existing
  ``_deep_close`` copies must agree (no silent 1e-9 vs 1e-6 divergence)
  and a synthetic regression strictly larger than the pinned window
  must still be detected. A lineage #6 that widens its own copy to
  absorb a flaky reproduction fails this test.
* ``test_every_results_ledger_conforms_to_shared_schema`` — kills the
  bespoke-ledger-schema generator (F4/F5): every ``build_*_ledger``
  must emit the shared required key set. A lineage #6 that invents a
  new RESULTS shape fails this test.
