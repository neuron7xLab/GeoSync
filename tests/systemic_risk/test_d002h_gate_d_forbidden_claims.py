"""D-002H Gate D — forbidden-claim scanner tests.

These tests exercise the scanner in
``scripts/x10r_d002h_gate_d_scan.py`` and assert that, on the current
working tree, no forbidden phrase from the locked D-002H
``forbidden_claims`` list leaks outside the denial context across the
scanned surface (D-002H/D-002G governance docs, D-002G/D-002H
artifacts, D-002G/D-002H commit acceptors, D-002G/D-002H tests).

Gate D is one term of the 7-gate canonical-run authorisation
conjunction (A AND B AND C AND D AND E AND F AND G). PASS of Gate D
alone does NOT authorise canonical run; the conjunction is the
contract.

The tests also pin the locked file-shas (D-002C claim ledger and D-002H
prereg) so a silent edit to either drops Gate D from PASS in the same
run as the byte-exact ledger / prereg guards.
