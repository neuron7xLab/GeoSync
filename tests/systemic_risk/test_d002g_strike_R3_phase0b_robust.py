"""Strike R3 — Phase 0b ``|t| < 2`` is mis-calibrated for bounded/skewed metrics.

Attack
------
The original Phase 0b uses a paired t-test (|t| < 2.0). The metrics it
operates on (``sync_auc`` is bounded on ``[0, T·R_max]``;
``tau_onset`` is right-censored) yield SKEWED distributions; the t-test
is mis-calibrated. Across 9 cells the family-wise α inflates.

Replacement (Strike-R3): require ``phase0b_robust`` to perform BOTH

  (a) Wilcoxon signed-rank ``p_value > 0.05`` (non-parametric, robust
      to skewed/bounded distributions), AND
  (b) BCa bootstrap 95% CI on ``mean(diffs)`` contains 0.

The original t-test value is kept for diagnostic continuity but NOT in
the verdict path.

This test exercises the helper directly so the test can land before the
Phase 0b integration test (which is bigger and runs the full integrator
sweep — out of scope for a unit test).
