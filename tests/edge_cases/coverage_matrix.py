"""Canonical IERD-Q7 edge-case coverage matrix (auditable, falsifiable).

IERD-PAI-FPS-UX-001 §5 / issue #532 require an
``(endpoint × state × test_id)`` matrix with

    ECC = covered applicable cells / total applicable cells ≥ 0.90

The honest, anti-theatre construction:

* The ten states are the §5 set verbatim.
* Endpoints are the gated public operations of the frozen OpenAPI
  spec (the same set IERD-Q5 scores), classified collection / command
  / probe. Applicability per class is explicit and documented — a
  ``probe`` has no collection cardinality, so ``empty`` / ``partial``
  are not scored against it (penalising an endpoint for a state that
  cannot exist for it is dishonest measurement, exactly as in Q5).
* A cell is ``covered`` only if it cites a **real, resolvable**
  test — a concrete pytest node (``path::func``) or a whole test
  module (``path``) that genuinely exercises that state for that
  endpoint class. ``tests/edge_cases/test_edge_case_matrix.py``
  statically verifies every cited target still exists (file present
  and, for ``path::func``, the function defined), so deleting or
  renaming a cited test fails the gate — the matrix has teeth.
* Cells with no genuine test yet are listed explicitly as
  ``UNCOVERED`` with a reason. No cell is silently assumed.

Phase-4 ENTRY (this revision): the honest ECC is ~0.78 (loading and
cancelled are pure client in-flight/abort states with no genuine test
until the frontend pages consume the endpoints; per-probe server_error
is untested). The gate therefore runs informationally
(``continue-on-error: true``) while the two §532 *hard* sub-
requirements — network_failure **and** timeout tested for every
applicable endpoint, and simulation_diverged correlated with
INV-DRO5 — are asserted fail-closed because they are genuinely met
today. Phase-4 EXIT lands Playwright route-interception specs for
loading / cancelled / per-probe server_error, lifting ECC ≥ 0.90 and
flipping the gate fail-closed (claim ANCHORED).
