## 0. TL;DR — What is GeoSync, in one paragraph

GeoSync is a **physics-first quantitative trading platform** with neuroscience-inspired
risk management. It is **not** a trading bot that uses physics metaphors — it is a
deterministic state machine in which every numerical claim is **anchored to a
peer-reviewed invariant**. The kernel ships **87 machine-checkable invariants** (Kuramoto
synchrony, Ollivier-Ricci curvature, dopamine TD error, serotonin ODE, GABA gate,
Lyapunov spectrum, free-energy descent, Landauer-budgeted predictability), each gated
by tests and CI. Three production substrata are bundled: a **risk engine**
(ECS regulator + conformal prediction + Kelly cap), a **regime observer** (DRO-ARA on
DFA-Hurst + ADF), and a **microstructure edge** (Ricci curvature on order-flow-imbalance
graphs, validated by an 11-axis falsification battery in `paper/ricci_microstructure/`).
Live-venue trading is **paper-only** as of this snapshot; that is the explicit boundary
of what is shippable today.

## 3. Maturity Tiers (honest)

Per `docs/CLAIMS.md` and `docs/PERFORMANCE_LEDGER.md`:

| Tier | Meaning | What lives here |
|---|---|---|
| **ANCHORED** | Empirical artefact + signed result + reproducible | Kuramoto inverse problem · Ricci microstructure paper (single-session) · Cross-asset Kuramoto regime (OOS Sharpe +1.262) · 87 P0/P1 invariants pass CI |
| **EXTRAPOLATED** | Theoretical/methodological grounding, partial empirical | ECS regulator · conformal gate · DRO-ARA · neuroeconomic decision stack |
| **SPECULATIVE** | Research-tier, not yet empirically validated on GeoSync data | NLCA, neuro-optimizer benchmarks, FPMA (literature-anchor only) |
| **UNKNOWN** | Not yet measured in this code base | Live-venue P&L · multi-asset regime accuracy · UX/API latency tier |

CI gate `invariant-count-sync` fail-closes if these tiers drift.

## 4. What is **shippable today** (5 components)

### 4.1 Kuramoto Synchronization Engine — `core/kuramoto/`
- 12 modules, 6 integrators (RK4, JAX/GPU, Sparse, Adaptive, Delayed, SecondOrder).
- 100+ unit + property tests; mypy `--strict` clean.
- Inverse problem: identify coupling K from observed phase trajectories.
- Buyer: hedge-fund quant teams, prop desks, risk-tech vendors.
- Gap to ship: high-frequency stress-test on >10K oscillators; GPU benchmark suite.

### 4.2 Ricci Microstructure Edge — `paper/ricci_microstructure/` + `research/microstructure/`
- 5.3-hour Binance USDT-M L2 demo, $n=19{,}081$.
- 11-axis falsification (permutation, bootstrap, deflated Sharpe, purged CV, transfer entropy, walk-forward).
- IC = 0.122, p = 0.002, DSR_IC = 15.1 (caveated as in-sample IC bar Sharpe, not annualised — see paper §abstract).
- Buyer: execution venues, latency arbitrage teams.
- Gap: forward OOS on a fresh L2 session; live integration SLA.

### 4.3 ECS-Inspired Regulator — `core/neuro/ecs_regulator.py`
- Free-energy-descent risk regulator with conformal prediction gate.
- SHA256 hash-chain audit trail (MiFID II-compatible).
- Buyer: asset managers, RegTech.
- Gap: live-venue evidence; certified external audit on conformal contract.

### 4.4 Reset Wave Engine — `geosync/neuroeconomics/reset_wave_engine.py`
- Damped phase synchronization on a compact manifold; snap-to-baseline primitive.
- 4 numerical invariants gated; deterministic O(N·steps) cost.
- Buyer: CTAs, "smooth-drawdown" risk vendors, pension funds.

### 4.5 DRO-ARA Regime Observer — `core/dro_ara/engine.py`
- Algebraic γ = 2H + 1 (Peng et al. 1994); fail-closed on NaN/Inf/short input.
- INV-DRO1..5 gated; long-signal admitted only under CRITICAL ∧ rs > 0.33.
- Buyer: multi-asset PMs, regime-switching strategies.

## 5. What is **NOT shippable today** (be honest with buyers)

1. **Live-venue trading.** Modules under `execution/` are paper-trading. `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md L-1` is binding. Real-capital deployment requires the Wave-4 engineering programme that is not in this snapshot.
2. **Multi-asset forward OOS** on Ricci microstructure. The paper documents one 5.3-hour single-asset-class session.
3. **Physics tier ≠ system tier.** 87 invariants cover the kernel; UX/API latency tier is `UNKNOWN` per `docs/CLAIMS.md`.
4. **NLCA / neuro-optimizer / FPMA** are research-tier or literature-anchor — not GeoSync-measured edges. The FPMA README has been corrected to flag this on 2026-05-05.

## 8. Two Go-To-Market Paths (PM analysis)

### Path A · B2B Quant Infrastructure (14–18 months to first checks)
- Audience: hedge-fund quant research teams, prop desks (2–4 analysts).
- Monetisation: SaaS subscription on Kuramoto + Ricci library ($5K–$15K/mo); custom physics consultation ($50K–$200K/contract); premium ECS-Regulator + Conformal Gate package ($2K–$5K/license).
- Recommended sequence: Q3 2026 alpha-partner with one fund → case study Q4 → scale to 3–5 by 2027 H1.

### Path B · Crypto/DeFi Platform Integration (9–12 months)
- Audience: DEX/L2 venues (dYdX, Paradigm, Wintermute), execution-routing networks.
- Monetisation: 0.5–2 bps fee on realised spread improvement (Ricci edge); $10K/mo retainer for "drawdown stabiliser for LP pools"; white-label reset-wave engine ($50K–$150K licensing).
- Lower regulatory bar than TradFi; faster to revenue but smaller per-deal size.

**Recommended combined strategy:** Path A as moat (credibility + early revenue) → fund a sales engineer → expand to Path B in 2027.

## 9. Top-3 Risks an Outside Reviewer Will Raise

1. **"Physics tier ≠ system tier."** Reframe with explicit two-tier disclosure: physics kernel = ANCHORED, operational surface = Wave-6 partial. Sell the physics product to quant shops separately from the trading product.
2. **"Paper trading only."** Reframe as "Infrastructure for Quant Research" (sell Kuramoto / Ricci / ECS as components) rather than turnkey algo trading.
3. **"Neuro metaphors will trigger compliance flags."** Replace public-facing language: "neuro-inspired" → "thermodynamic constraints under free-energy principle + conformal prediction." Keep the neuroanatomy in `docs/neuroecon.md` and `~/CANONICAL_NEURO_MAPPING_2026_05_05.md` as research notes.

## 11. Open Items Tracked (for the next maintainer)

- 5 `NEURO-THEATER` modules (cosmetic neuro-naming without functional homology) flagged in audit; non-blocking but should either be renamed or have their docstrings honest about the analogy.
- 5 `CONTRACT-IMPL DRIFTS` documented in audit; one (INV-DA7 scope) closed in this snapshot via bus-slot docstring.
- ~10 dangling test-file naming patterns (target module name ≠ test file basename) — verified as functional, no action required.
- Live-venue evidence is the next blocker for Path A acceleration.

- [ ] Read `~/CANONICAL_NEURO_MAPPING_2026_05_05.md` if you intend to extend the neuro-stack.
- [ ] Read `~/CANONICAL_ARTIFACT_2026_05_05.md` if you want the author's first-principles voice.
- [ ] Pick a Path (A or B in §8) and commit a 90-day plan.
