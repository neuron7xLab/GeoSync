"""CALIB-GRID-001 — external ground-truth calibration of the Kuramoto stack.

Pre-registered, fail-closed calibration of GeoSync's Sakaguchi–Kuramoto
inverse-problem stack against the power-grid Kuramoto reduction
(Dörfler & Bullo, PNAS 2013) on canonical IEEE test systems. This is a
calibration instrument, **not** a scientific hypothesis: the ground
truth is already known exactly from published admittance / injection
data and a closed-form synchronisation condition.

See ``README.md``, ``PREREGISTRATION.md``, and ``PROVENANCE.md``.
