"""D-002H Gate D — forbidden-claim scanner.

Walks the D-002H governance / artifact / acceptor / test surface and
records every line that contains a forbidden phrase from the locked
D-002H pre-registration ``forbidden_claims`` list (sha256
``44b18b5a40ce9d188a9c3bd49339621f81a65a15f97a683247902450dd54acec``).

A line is a **leak** iff:

* the line contains a forbidden phrase (case-insensitive substring), AND
* neither the line itself nor any line in the symmetric context
  window (``CONTEXT_LINES_BEFORE`` lines above, ``CONTEXT_LINES_AFTER``
  lines below) contains any of ``ALLOWED_DENIAL_MARKERS``.

The window is asymmetric because denial framing in this corpus is
typically introduced by a heading or list header above the bulleted
phrase (e.g. ``NO null-domain admissibility verdict may promote to:``
followed by a bulleted ``* D-002C rescue claim.``). A small forward
window catches inline trailing denials such as
``D-002C rescue   <- this is the forbidden phrase, not a claim``.

Files in :data:`SCANNER_EXEMPT_PATHS` are skipped: these files
intentionally enumerate the forbidden phrases as guard literals (the
scanner itself, the prereg ``forbidden_claims`` list, the
claim-boundary doc with its ``❌`` forbidden-interpretation block, etc.)
and would dominate the leak count with self-references.

Gate D contract per
``docs/governance/D002H_CANONICAL_RUN_AUTHORIZATION_GATES.md`` §D:

    Gate D PASS iff zero leaks outside the denial context across the
    scanned surface.

PASS of Gate D **alone does NOT authorise the canonical D-002H run**;
the conjunction A ∧ B ∧ C ∧ D ∧ E ∧ F ∧ G is the authorisation
contract.
