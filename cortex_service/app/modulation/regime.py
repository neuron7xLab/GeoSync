"""Market regime modulation algorithms.

Sprint 4 split: the previous monolithic ``RegimeModulator`` combined
three responsibilities — blending, classification, and process-level
execution — into one class that had to be reconstructed on any tuning
change. Those responsibilities are now three orthogonal objects:

* ``ModulationPolicy`` — pure, stateless, computes ``(valence,
  confidence)`` from an incoming tick. Hot-swappable at runtime.
* ``_classify`` — the thresholds that turn numerical valence into a
  label. Kept as a free function because it is orthogonal to policy
  choice.
* ``RegimeModulator`` — the executor that holds the current policy
  pointer and applies it. ``swap_policy`` replaces the pointer
  atomically without recreating the modulator, so the long-running
  cortex service can change blending behaviour in flight.

``ExponentialDecayPolicy`` preserves the pre-Sprint-4 behaviour
byte-for-byte — it is constructed by default so every existing caller
continues to work without changes.
