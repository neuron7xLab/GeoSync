"""Physical-law catalog loader, registry, and ``@law`` witness decorator.

Philosophy
----------
A test is not a line-coverage artefact; it is a *mathematical witness* that a
specific physical law of GeoSync holds in code. Every witness binds itself to
a law by dotted id (e.g. ``kuramoto.subcritical_finite_size``) via the ``@law``
decorator. The binding is checked at collection time by ``tools/validate_tests``
which:

1. rejects witnesses that reference a non-existent ``law_id``;
2. rejects magic-literal asserts that cannot be traced back to the law's
   ``tolerance`` / ``variables`` fields;
3. reports *physical-law-coverage* — the fraction of laws in the catalog that
   have at least one registered witness of sufficient statistical power.

This module is deliberately dependency-light: only ``pyyaml`` (already in
``requirements`` via ``pytest-cov`` config) and the Python stdlib.

    Behaviour:
    - Resolves the law eagerly at import time and raises ``KeyError`` if the
      id is unknown. This turns typos into import errors, caught by collection.
    - Records a ``_WitnessRecord`` in ``WITNESS_REGISTRY[law_id]`` for the CI
      gate to audit. The record includes the test qualname, its defining
      module, and any keyword arguments the author chose to declare (e.g. the
      N / trials used for the scaling witness — these arguments are exposed
      to ``tools/validate_tests`` so it can check that the declared statistics
      actually match what the test runs).
    - Attaches the resolved ``Law`` to the wrapped function as ``__law__`` so
      tests that want to read tolerances off the law can do so without a
      second catalog lookup.
