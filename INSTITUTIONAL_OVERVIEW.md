# TradePulse — Institutional Overview

**Quantitative Research Infrastructure for Sophisticated Market Participants**

*Confidential — For Institutional Evaluation Purposes*

</div>

---

## Executive Summary

TradePulse is an advanced quantitative trading infrastructure platform combining novel geometric signal generation with institutional-grade execution, risk management, and observability. The platform's signal layer is built on mathematical mechanisms sourced from peer-reviewed scientific literature — Kuramoto phase synchronization, Ricci curvature flow on graph manifolds, and thermodynamic free-energy principles — providing a structural alpha source distinct from conventional factor models or price-momentum heuristics.

The engineering foundation targets institutional scale: event-driven order management, Kubernetes-native deployment, Prometheus/OpenTelemetry telemetry, NIST SP 800-53–aligned security controls, and a 97,000-line codebase validated by a 681-test quality suite with an enforced 98% coverage gate on critical execution paths.

**Platform status**: Pre-production beta (v0.1.0). Core engine stable and available for institutional sandbox evaluation.

## The Investment Thesis

### Why Geometric Market Intelligence?

Modern quantitative finance increasingly faces alpha decay in traditional factor strategies (value, momentum, carry, quality) as these signals become crowded and priced-in. The structural edge of TradePulse lies in measuring market dynamics through the lens of dynamical systems theory and differential geometry:

| Conventional Approach | TradePulse Approach |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Price and volume factors | Phase synchronization across instruments (Kuramoto) |
| Correlation matrices (static) | Ricci curvature flow on dynamic market graphs |
| Volatility regimes (heuristic) | Thermodynamic free-energy regime classification (TACL) |
| Momentum signals | Entropy-theoretic information flow measures |
| Rule-based risk gates | Neuromodulatory adaptive sizing (dopamine/serotonin models) |

Each mechanism is scientifically grounded — not an empirical pattern fit to historical data, but a structural mathematical property of coupled dynamical systems applied to market microstructure.

### Scientific Lineage

TradePulse indicators derive from validated theoretical frameworks:

- **Kuramoto Synchronization** (Kuramoto 1984, Strogatz 2000) — phase-coupled oscillator model used to detect synchrony transitions in cross-asset dynamics
- **Ricci Flow on Graphs** (Hamilton 1982, Ollivier 2009, Sandhu et al. 2015) — curvature-based measurement of information geometry; applied to market networks to detect fragility and regime shift
- **Free Energy Principle** (Friston 2010) — thermodynamic framework for adaptive system behaviour; drives the TACL (Thermodynamic Autonomic Control Layer) regime classifier
- **Multiscale Fractal Analysis** (Mandelbrot, Hurst) — multi-timeframe self-similarity measures for trend regime identification
- **Information-Theoretic Entropy** (Shannon, Tsallis) — cross-asset mutual information and complexity measures

## Platform Capabilities

### Signal Generation

```
core/indicators/
├── kuramoto.py               Phase synchronization — cross-asset cohesion measure
├── multiscale_kuramoto.py    Multi-timeframe synchronization decomposition
├── kuramoto_ricci_composite.py  Composite synchrony + curvature signal
├── ricci.py                  Ricci curvature on dynamic market graphs
├── entropy.py                Shannon / Tsallis entropy; transfer entropy
├── fractal_gcl.py            Fractal dimension; Hurst exponent
├── hurst.py                  Long-range dependence measure
└── trading.py                Composite indicator builder
```

All indicators implement a versioned interface (`core/indicators/base.py`) with deterministic replay guarantees — signal computation is reproducible to the bit level for a given input dataset and parameter set.

### Backtesting Engine

- **Event-driven simulation** with fill-model fidelity (slippage, commissions, market impact)
- **Walk-forward optimization** with purged cross-validation to guard against look-ahead contamination
- **Property-based testing** via Hypothesis — strategies are validated against thousands of generated market scenarios, not just historical paths
- **Golden-path deterministic tests** — 21 reference backtest runs with locked expected outputs; any regression is caught by CI

### Execution Layer

- **Order Management System** (`execution/oms.py`, 50 KB) — full order lifecycle with pre-trade risk checks
- **Exchange Connectors** — CCXT (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, Bybit), Alpaca (US equities/options), Polygon (market data)
- **Capital Optimizer** — Kelly-based and mean-variance position sizing with configurable risk budgets
- **Router** — smart order routing across venues with latency and fee optimization
- **Kill Switch** — cryptographically authenticated emergency halt; activatable via API or CLI

### Risk Management

| Control | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Pre-trade position limits | Configurable per-symbol and portfolio-level notional caps |
| Daily loss cap | Automatic circuit-breaker; halts order flow at threshold |
| Drawdown kill-switch | Portfolio-level max drawdown enforcement with graceful wind-down |
| Leverage constraints | Hard and soft leverage limits with alerting |
| Correlation monitoring | Real-time cross-position correlation; automatic hedge triggers |
| Compliance checks | MiFID II, FINRA pattern implementation; SEC position reporting hooks |

### Observability & Audit

- **Prometheus** metrics on every execution path — latency, fill rates, PnL, signal values
- **OpenTelemetry** distributed tracing — full request genealogy from signal to execution
- **Structured audit log** — 400-day retention, immutable append-only; supports post-trade forensics and regulatory examination
- **Deterministic replay** — any historical time window can be replayed with identical signal and execution logic for attribution analysis
- **Streamlit dashboard** — real-time portfolio status, signal visualisation, regime map (pre-production, hardening in progress)
