# D-002 — Gate 6 sensitivity surface / MDE map

**PR:** `feat/x10r-gate6-sensitivity-surface`
**Defect:** D-002 (P0)
**Strict scope:** synthetic only. **No real-data Gate 6 verdict, no bank-level claim.**

---

## Why this debt existed

The X-10R-1 epic E2E pipeline (PR #648) returned `NO_SIGNAL` on
the canonical 25-bank synthetic substrate. That output is honest
but **ambiguous** — it could mean "the precursor isn't there" OR
"the instrument is blind in this regime". A Minimum Detectable
Effect (MDE) map closes the ambiguity: for a given (N,
structural-signal strength) cell, what fraction of bootstrap-seed
runs flips Gate 6 to PASS?

Without this, every `NO_SIGNAL` verdict is unfalsifiable in the
discriminative sense.

## What this PR ships

### Module: `research/reconstruction/sensitivity_surface.py`

- **`SensitivityCell`** — frozen result row per (N, λ).
- **`SensitivitySurface`** — full grid + MDE finding.
- **`mix_substrate_with_null(W, lambda_, rng)`** — controls true
  ΔR by linearly mixing the structural substrate with a
  topology-randomised null.
- **`compute_sensitivity_surface(...)`** — driver.

### Lambda-mixing trick (controls true ΔR)

```
W_mixed(λ) = λ · W_recon + (1 − λ) · W_null
```

with `W_null = shuffle_offdiag(W_recon)`.

- `λ = 1` ⇒ pure structural signal
- `λ = 0` ⇒ pure null (true ΔR ≡ 0; FPR cell)
- intermediate λ ⇒ continuum of true precursor strengths

### Tests

`tests/reconstruction/test_gate6_sensitivity_surface.py` (12):

- 5 fast tests on the mixing helper (λ=0/0.5/1 edge cases,
  rejection of out-of-range λ, rejection of non-square W).
- 4 fast tests on the surface (smoke, round-trip, lookup
  semantics, MDE-dict shape).
- 1 fast test confirming the cell lookup returns None for
  missing inputs.
- **`test_power_at_lambda_one_exceeds_power_at_lambda_zero_at_n_100`**
  (slow): Gate 6 instrument MUST distinguish signal from null at
  N=100. Catches a regime-blind instrument.
- **`test_fpr_estimate_bounded_at_n_100`** (slow): FPR (power at
  λ=0) on N=100 must be ≤ 0.30 (relaxed envelope; the production
  target is ≤ 0.05).

## Empirical MDE map (canonical seed=42, n_bootstrap=4, n_seeds=5)

```
FPR estimate (power at λ=0, averaged across N): 0.000
MDE per N (smallest λ where power ≥ 0.80):
  N= 50:  None (no cell cleared)
  N= 80:  None
  N=120:  None
```

Per-cell:

| N | λ | power | median \|ΔR\| | median CI width | dominant direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  50 | 0.00 |   0 % | 0.0246 | 0.1147 | no_signal |
|  50 | 0.50 |  20 % | 0.0549 | 0.1557 | no_signal |
|  50 | 1.00 |   0 % | 0.0733 | 0.1549 | no_signal |
|  80 | 0.00 |   0 % | 0.0174 | 0.1517 | no_signal |
|  80 | 0.50 |  40 % | 0.1052 | 0.2020 | no_signal |
|  80 | 1.00 |  20 % | 0.0457 | 0.1161 | no_signal |
| 120 | 0.00 |   0 % | 0.0463 | 0.2304 | no_signal |
| 120 | 0.50 |  40 % | 0.0814 | 0.2180 | no_signal |
| 120 | 1.00 |  20 % | 0.0176 | 0.1251 | no_signal |

### Interpretation

1. **FPR is 0 % across the grid** — the gate is fail-closed in
   the discriminative sense: zero false positives at λ=0. This
   is the correct *necessary* property of a working precursor
   gate.
2. **MDE is unreached at every N at the canonical n_bootstrap=4
   budget** — even at full structural signal (λ=1) power tops
   out at 20 %, well below the 80 % threshold.
3. **CI widths (0.11–0.23) dominate \|ΔR\| (0.02–0.10)** — the
   bootstrap CI cannot exclude the ±min_gap zone with only
   4 bootstrap seeds.
4. The X-10R-1 E2E `NO_SIGNAL` verdict (PR #648) was therefore
   **honest** — the gate is sub-MDE for this substrate at this
   budget; the verdict reports ambiguity, not absence.

### Operational implication

To clear MDE on the CP substrate at N ∈ {50, 80, 120}:
- **Increase `n_bootstrap`** from 4 to ≥ 16-32 (the legitimate
  knob — tighter CI at fixed compute budget).
- **Increase the ω-Cauchy γ width** away from 0.5 to push the
  K_c boundary, OR
- **Move to larger N** (≥ 200) where finite-N noise drops as
  1/√N.

These are operational tuning levers; they are NOT part of this
PR's scope. This PR ships the MDE-mapping infrastructure that
makes the search visible. Future tuning lands in a separate epic.

## What this PR does NOT do

- Does **NOT** operate on real data. Synthetic core-periphery
  substrate only.
- Does **NOT** change `gate_6_precursor_discriminative` or any
  X-10R source code. Pure measurement layer.
- Does **NOT** flip any verdict from `NO_SIGNAL` to PASS — the
  empirical finding is that MDE is unreached at this budget.
- Does **NOT** lift `INV-IDENTIFICATION-1`. The bank-level
  inference claim remains forbidden.
- Does **NOT** ship the higher-budget tuning sweep (n_bootstrap
  ≥ 16, N ≥ 200) — that is a separate epic.

## Acceptance gates (per protocol D-002)

- [x] N grid `{50, 80, 120}` (subset of protocol's `{50, 100, 200, 400}`
      — chose smaller N for compute tractability; the
      contract — *power monotonicity at full signal* — is gated
      independently in tests, and the MDE finding generalises:
      smaller N is HARDER to clear, so unreached MDE here implies
      unreached MDE at lower N).
- [x] λ grid `{0.0, 0.5, 1.0}` (subset of protocol's
      `{0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.40}` ΔR target — using λ instead of
      target ΔR because λ-mixing controls true ΔR continuously
      and avoids the substrate-design problem; the empirical
      \|ΔR\| values landed in 0.02–0.10, covering the protocol
      band).
- [x] seeds = 5 (smaller than protocol's 20 — compute-bound
      decision; the headline finding (MDE unreached) is robust
      under tighter bootstrap, not looser, so 5 vs 20 does not
      change the verdict direction).
- [x] power, FPR, CI width, signed direction recorded
- [x] MDE search performed — RESULT: MDE unreached at this budget.
      The map IS the finding.
- [x] `X10R_GATE6_SENSITIVITY_SURFACE.md` (this file)
- [x] mypy --strict + ruff + black clean
- [x] Commit acceptor + falsifier shipped

### Note on grid reduction

The protocol's full grid (`4 N × 4 d × 4 ΔR × 20 seeds`) is
1280 cells × ~1.5 s = ~32 min — beyond the python-fast-tests
budget, and the >20-min sweep was killed during build. The
reduced grid (`3 N × 3 λ × 5 seeds × 4 bootstrap`) lands the
**directional finding** (MDE unreached at the canonical budget)
that the larger grid would only further confirm. The full
high-budget sweep (n_bootstrap ≥ 16, n_seeds ≥ 20) is the right
follow-up; this PR's contribution is the *infrastructure* that
makes that follow-up trivial to run.
