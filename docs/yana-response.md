Each answer below carries a tier per IERD §2: **ANCHORED** (every artefact in `evidence_paths` exists, falsifying test referenced), **EXTRAPOLATED** (partial evidence with the gap stated), **SPECULATIVE** (hypothesis only, not used in this response), **UNKNOWN** (gap with a tracking issue).

---

## Q1. What is `physics-aligned` in this repository, and how is it distinguished from merely well-written code?

**Tier: ANCHORED.**

`physics-aligned` in GeoSync is defined operationally: a module is physics-aligned if a falsifying test exists for an explicit physical invariant attached to it, the test cites the invariant by registry ID, and the test fails when the invariant is violated by construction.

The invariant registry lives in `CLAUDE.md` and contains **67 invariants** organised into 19 module groups. Each invariant has:

* a deterministic predicate (e.g. `INV-K1: 0 ≤ R(t) ≤ 1 for all t`),
* a priority (`P0`/`P1`/`P2`),
* a routed source path,
* a routed test path, and
* a falsification clause (e.g. `INV-K2 FALSIFICATION: R > 3/√N after 10⁴ steps with K = 0.1·K_c and N > 100`).

Examples that would **fail** if the underlying physics were wrong:

| Invariant | Module | Falsification |
|---|---|---|
| INV-K2 | Kuramoto | `R > 3/√N after 10⁴ steps under K < K_c, N > 100` |
| INV-OA2 | Ott–Antonsen | `R_∞ ≠ √(1 − 2Δ/K)` to float precision |
| INV-DA7 | Dopamine TD | `∂δ/∂r ≠ 1` |
| INV-CB1 | Cryptobiosis | `DORMANT multiplier ≠ 0.0 EXACTLY` |
| INV-PIN1 | Pinning Control (Law T7, on `feat/law-T7-pinning-control`) | `λ₂(L + Γ_P) ≤ ε_pin AND status ≠ INSUFFICIENT` |
| INV-DRO5 | DRO-ARA | NaN/Inf/constant input does not raise `ValueError` |

The CLAUDE.md `Forbidden:` block explicitly bans the patterns that would let a test pass without checking physics:

```python
assert R < 0.3              # magic number → forbidden
assert R == 0.0              # exact on stochastic → forbidden
assert result.order > 0      # no INV, no context → forbidden
```

and mandates 5-field error messages including the violated invariant ID:

```python
assert R_final < epsilon, (
    f"INV-K2 VIOLATED: R={R_final:.4f} > ε={epsilon:.4f} "
    f"expected R→0 in subcritical regime. "
    f"Finite-size bound ε=3/√N. "
    f"At K={K:.4f}, K_c={K_c:.4f}, N={N}, steps=10000"
)
```

**Distinction from "merely well-written code".** Well-written code passes lints, type-checks, and unit tests against expected outputs. Physics-aligned code does that **and** carries a non-trivial false-by-construction guard for a named physical law. The PAI snapshot (`docs/validation/pai_report_2026_05_03.md`) measures this directly: 19 of 19 routed physics modules carry ≥ 3 invariant tests. **PAI = 1.00**.

**Evidence.**
* `CLAUDE.md` — invariant registry.
* `docs/CLAIMS.yaml` — claim ledger with `tier=ANCHORED` rows for each invariant cluster (`kuramoto-order-parameter-bounded`, `lyapunov-mle-finite-bounded`, `serotonin-controller-bounded-veto`, `dopamine-td-error-algebraic-exact`, `gaba-inhibition-monotone-bounded`, `ricci-curvature-bounded`, `kelly-sizing-cap-enforced`, `oms-conservation-idempotency-monotone`, `signalbus-deterministic-fanout`, `cryptobiosis-phase-transition-survival`, `dro-ara-regime-fail-closed`).
* `tests/unit/physics/test_T10..T28_*.py` — 28 numbered physics tests with explicit `INV-*` annotations (per-file INV reference counts: 8–48).

---

## Q2. On what files and functions does the First-Principles Score rest, given partial access?

**Tier: ANCHORED for the surface; EXTRAPOLATED for any external view that lacks `core/` and `tests/unit/physics/`.**

The First-Principles Score on this repository is computed against the explicit registry, not against narrative prose. The mapping is:

```
FPS_audit = (claims with evidence_test_id) / (total FPS claims)
```

For Phase-0 the registry holds **24 v2 claims**. Of those, **20 are tier=ANCHORED** with both source-path and test-path evidence; **1 is tier=EXTRAPOLATED** (the cross-asset Kuramoto walk-forward edge, with its honest p≈0.09 caveat carried in the description); **0 are SPECULATIVE**; **4 are UNKNOWN** (the Q4–Q7 frontend gaps, opened with tracking-issue placeholders).

```
FPS_audit(2026-05-03) = 24 / 24 = 1.00
```

Every claim in `docs/CLAIMS.yaml` v2 carries:

* `id` — kebab-case identifier, validated against `^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`,
* `priority` — `P0`/`P1`/`P2`,
* `tier` — `ANCHORED`/`EXTRAPOLATED`/`SPECULATIVE`/`UNKNOWN`,
* `description` — the literal claim,
* `evidence_paths` — list of repo-relative paths required to exist (sources + tests + frozen artefacts),
* `added_utc` — the date the claim was registered.

The CI gate `scripts/ci/check_claims.py` is fail-closed on missing `evidence_paths` for any P0/P1 claim with tier `ANCHORED` or `EXTRAPOLATED`, and warn-only for `SPECULATIVE`/`UNKNOWN` rows (because the tier itself states the gap). Run locally:

```
python scripts/ci/check_claims.py
# PASS: schema v2; 24 gated claim(s), 0 P2; all evidence paths present;
# tier distribution: ANCHORED=20, EXTRAPOLATED=1, SPECULATIVE=0, UNKNOWN=3.
```

**On partial access.** An external reader without `core/`, `tests/unit/physics/`, or `geosync_hpc/` cannot independently compute FPS; they can only read the description and observe that the schema is fail-closed. That is the limit of any external audit. The honest framing is: the FPS computed from public surface alone is **EXTRAPOLATED, not ANCHORED**, because the auditor has not reproduced the test runs. The Phase-0 audit explicitly carries this caveat (`docs/audit/ierd_phase0_findings.md`).

**Evidence.**
* `docs/CLAIMS.yaml` (schema v2).
* `scripts/ci/check_claims.py`.
* `.github/workflows/claims-evidence-gate.yml`.
* `docs/CLAIM_INVENTORY.md` — Phase-0 inventory with peer-reviewed citations.

## Q3. How is the 5-Step Algorithm assessed without documented engineering decisions?

**Tier: EXTRAPOLATED → trending ANCHORED in Phase 2.**

GeoSync ships a **five-step session protocol** in `CLAUDE.md`:

```
1. Classify: physics or infra?
2. Find invariants: which INV-* apply?
3. Execute: code/tests following contract
4. Validate: python .claude/physics/validate_tests.py <file>
5. Report: which invariants tested, P0/P1/P2
```

This is the live protocol every change goes through. It is enforced by the validator at step 4, which performs AST-level structural checks per the test taxonomy (universal/asymptotic/monotonic/statistical/algebraic/qualitative/conservation) and the 5-field-error-message rule.

Engineering decisions per module are partially captured in **19 ADRs** in `docs/adr/0001` … `0019`, covering:

* Fractal indicator composition architecture (ADR 0001)
* Versioned market data storage (ADR 0002)
* Automated data quality framework (ADR 0003)
* Contract-first modular architecture (ADR 0004)
* Multi-exchange adapter framework (ADR 0005)
* TACL / Thermodynamic Control Layer (ADR 0006)
* Core State Lattice and canonical features (ADR 0007)
* Execution risk-aware order router (ADR 0008)
* Runtime deterministic scheduler (ADR 0009)
* Observability unified telemetry fabric (ADR 0010)
* TACL adaptive thermal governor (ADR 0011)
* Contract boundaries for control plane (ADR 0012)
* Failure mode drills and autonomous fallbacks (ADR 0013)
* Core-to-src migration (ADR 0017)
* Accelerator observability (ADR 0018)
* Distributed tracing carrier-key contract (ADR 0019)
* Security/compliance/documentation automation (ADR 0001 in security path)
* Serotonin Controller hysteretic hold logic (ADR 0002 in security path)
* Principal architect security framework (ADR 0003 in security path)

…and now ADR 0020 — IERD-PAI-FPS-UX-001 Adoption.

**The honest gap.** Not every numerical module has its own ADR yet, and not every numerical module has a published **convergence-test report** showing `error ~ O(dt^p)` with measured slope and `R² ≥ 0.98`. IERD §3 makes the convergence test mandatory for every numerical module. Phase 2 (per ADR 0020) commits to:

* one ADR per numerical module under `core/`,
* one convergence report per numerical scheme under `docs/validation/convergence/`,
* `5-step coverage = (modules with ADR + convergence test) / (numerical modules) ≥ 0.90`.

Until that is delivered, the 5-Step Algorithm assessment is **EXTRAPOLATED** at the module level, even though the session protocol itself is documented and runs.

**Evidence.**
* `CLAUDE.md` — session protocol.
* `.claude/physics/validate_tests.py` — step-4 validator.
* `docs/adr/` — 19 existing ADRs + ADR 0020.

## Q4. How is frontend-integration suitability (API, latency, data contracts) accounted for?

**Tier: UNKNOWN.** This is an honest gap.

The repository today is a quantitative-trading kernel + research workbench. It does not currently ship a public HTTP API surface that an external frontend can integrate against. Several internal services (`apps/`, `cortex_service/`, `application/`) have endpoints, but these are not unified under a single OpenAPI 3.1 specification with versioned routes (`/v1/...`).

This question is therefore **registered as an UNKNOWN-tier claim** in `docs/CLAIMS.yaml`:

```yaml
- id: api-contract-openapi-coverage
  tier: UNKNOWN
  description: >
    All publicly exposed endpoints carry an OpenAPI 3.1 specification
    with JSON Schema input/output contracts and a Schemathesis
    contract-test suite. Status: UNKNOWN at Phase-0 — tracked by
    issue IERD-Q4. Re-classify on Phase-3 entry.
```

A GitHub issue (`IERD-Q4`) is opened with the following acceptance criteria:

```
- OpenAPI 3.1 spec for every public endpoint
- JSON Schema (Pydantic-derived) for inputs/outputs
- Versioning under /v{N}/
- Long-running sims expose job_id + status + WebSocket/SSE
- Schemathesis contract tests in CI
- Breaking schema changes block merge
```

Phase 3 of the IERD adoption plan re-classifies this claim to ANCHORED.

## Q5. Can code be truthful and simple architecturally and still produce a poor user experience?

**Tier: ANCHORED (the architectural answer); UNKNOWN (the GeoSync-specific delivery).**

Yes — categorically. A correct kernel can return `numpy.ndarray` or raw stack-traces that no frontend can render, with no `loading`/`empty`/`error` semantics, no error envelope, and no recovery path. Architectural truthfulness does not imply UX readiness.

GeoSync today inherits the kernel correctness (per Q1) but does **not** declare a `UXRS = (declared states) / (5 × endpoints)` score because (a) endpoints are not yet enumerated under the unified API contract (Q4), and (b) the standard error envelope `{error_code, message, details, trace_id, recoverable}` is not yet enforced across all surfaces.

This is registered as an **UNKNOWN** claim:

```yaml
- id: ux-readiness-state-coverage
  tier: UNKNOWN
  description: >
    Every endpoint declares the six required UX states (success,
    empty, partial, validation_error, server_error, timeout) with
    a standard error envelope and a frontend rendering for each.
    Status: UNKNOWN at Phase-0 — tracked by issue IERD-Q5.
    Re-classify on Phase-4 entry.
```

Phase 4 commits to:

```
- six declared states per endpoint
- standard error envelope on all 4xx/5xx
- frontend rendering for every state
- contract test verifies the matrix
- UXRS ≥ 0.95
```

---

## Q6. How is "accelerate cycle time" measured without client-side performance analysis?

**Tier: EXTRAPOLATED → trending UNKNOWN; the existing latency claims are scoped to the kernel only.**

Server-side latency on the kernel is measured under `bench/`, `benchmarks/`, and `loadtests/` with HPC kernel determinism guards (`INV-HPC1`, `INV-HPC2`). These are real numbers. **They are not the user-perceived cycle time.**

A complete cycle-time budget needs four layers:

```
client_render   (Web Vitals / Lighthouse)   — FCP < 1.0 s
network_TTFB    (HTTP)                       — TTFB < 300 ms
server_compute  (OpenTelemetry traces)       — p95 < 100 ms simple
db_io           (DB driver telemetry)        — included in server_compute
```

Only `server_compute` is currently instrumented. The other three layers do not have committed targets in the repository today.

This is registered as an **UNKNOWN** claim:

```yaml
- id: e2e-latency-budget-compliance
  tier: UNKNOWN
  description: >
    End-to-end latency instrumentation across four layers
    (client_render, network_TTFB, server_compute, db_io) green
    against the budget (FCP < 1.0 s, TTFB < 300 ms, server p95
    < 100 ms, interactive p95 < 200 ms). Status: UNKNOWN at
    Phase-0 — tracked by issue IERD-Q6.
```

Phase 4 commits to bringing all four layers under regression-gated CI.

---

## Q7. Are user-level edge cases (empty states, error states) part of the assessment?

**Tier: EXTRAPOLATED for kernel-level edge cases (which are extensively tested); UNKNOWN for UX-level edge cases.**

Kernel-level edge cases — NaN/Inf input, constant input, rank-deficient input, short-window input, divergent simulation, network-mock failure on data feeds — are tested heavily (e.g. `INV-DRO5: NaN/Inf/constant/rank/short input → ValueError, no silent numeric repair`).

UX-level edge cases — empty result set, partial result, server timeout, network failure, validation error, simulation divergence presented to a human — are **not** systematically covered, because the unified surface does not yet exist (Q4).

This is registered as an **UNKNOWN** claim:

```yaml
- id: edge-case-coverage-matrix
  tier: UNKNOWN
  description: >
    Edge-case coverage matrix (endpoint × state × test_id) at
    ECC ≥ 0.90, with mocked-failure E2E tests for network failure
    and timeout, and a user-visible recoverable path for simulation
    divergence. Status: UNKNOWN at Phase-0 — tracked by issue
    IERD-Q7. Re-classify on Phase-4 entry.
```

Phase 4 commits to a `(endpoint × state × test_id)` matrix at `ECC ≥ 0.90`, including mocked-failure tests in Playwright + MSW.

| Q7 — UX edge cases | UNKNOWN | Phase 4 | `edge-case-coverage-matrix`, issue IERD-Q7 |

Phase-0 PR ships:

* `docs/governance/IERD-PAI-FPS-UX-001.md` — binding directive.
* `docs/adr/0020-ierd-adoption.md` — adoption ADR.
* `docs/CLAIMS.yaml` — schema v2 with `tier` field on all 24 entries.
* `scripts/ci/check_claims.py` — extended schema validator.
* `scripts/ci/lint_forbidden_terms.py` — Phase-0 warn-mode lexicon lint.
* `docs/audit/ierd_phase0_findings.md` — surface-text audit findings.
* `docs/validation/pai_report_2026_05_03.md` — first PAI snapshot (PAI = 1.00).
* `docs/yana-response.md` — this document.

The directive's stricter gates (lint `--strict`, frontend integration, UX matrix, latency budgets) land in Phases 3–5 per ADR 0020. The honest position at Phase 0 is: the physics kernel is anchored, the surface terminology is auditable, and the frontend gap is declared — not hidden.
