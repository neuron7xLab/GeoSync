# Canonical Documentation Quality Audit

**Date:** 2026-05-05
**Branch:** `integration/canonical-2026-05-05`
**HEAD:** `821f020` (tag `canonical-2026-05-05`)
**Operator:** Vasylenko Yaroslav
**Auditor role:** Documentation Quality Auditor (verification-first, fail-closed, local-evidence-bound)

---

## Status

**PASS_WITH_LIMITATIONS** (extended pass — 2026-05-05, second sweep)

The audit was executed in two passes against a 659-document
documentation surface.

* **Pass 1** (initial): 4 files repaired — README badge, DELIVERY
  broken paths, and provenance disclaimers on the two 2025-12-08
  reports.
* **Pass 2** (this sweep, second run): per-file review of the 21-file
  catalog. Of those, **8 files** received per-file edits (downgrade
  language to observed scope), **5 files** received provenance-headers
  reframing historical strong wording, and **8 files** were judged
  contextually correct (overclaim phrases used in negation, governance
  rule definitions, claim-tier definitions, or self-audit findings)
  and were left unchanged.

Remaining mentions of strong tokens after the sweep are **inside
provenance-blocks themselves** (the disclaimer text quotes the original
strong wording so a grep still hits) or inside the legitimate
contextual classes listed above. A purely numerical re-grep therefore
shows a slight *increase* in raw hits (133 → 150) because every
provenance block contains the original phrase being disclaimed; the
semantic outcome is the opposite — every surface now has an explicit
boundary statement.

This documentation is verified against current local repository evidence
only. It does not claim complete scientific, production, or external
validation.

## Repository state at audit start

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Branch | `integration/canonical-2026-05-05` |
| HEAD | `821f020` |
| Tag at HEAD | `canonical-2026-05-05` |
| Tracked-clean source files | yes (no `.py`, `.md` in `M` state from the audit run) |
| Tracked dirty (runtime self-updating logs) | yes — `agent/reports/*.json`, `observability/audit/*.jsonl`, `results/cross_asset_kuramoto/shadow_validation/*`, `results/dro_ara_bench.json` |
| Untracked files touched | no |

The dirty tracked-state on session start is **runtime self-updating
artefacts** (jsonl event logs, live-state JSON, scoreboard CSV). These
are not source code, tests, or documentation; per Phase 0 protocol
they are not blockers for a docs audit. They are not modified by this
audit.

## Scope

### Phase 1 — inventory

```
find . -path './.git' -prune -o -path './.venv' -prune -o \
       -path './.claude/worktrees' -prune -o \
       -path './node_modules' -prune -o -path './vendor' -prune -o \
       \( -name '*.md' -o -name '*.rst' \) -print
```

| Metric | Count |
|---|---:|
| Total `.md` / `.rst` files | **659** |
| In `docs/` | 425 |
| In `results/` | 45 |
| In `reports/` | 26 |
| In `.github/` | 24 |
| In `newsfragments/` (changelog fragments) | 17 |
| In `core/`, `scripts/`, `infra/`, `.claude/` | 11+ each |

### Phase 4 — overclaim scan

Pattern set (zero-tolerance and high-risk combined):
```
production-grade|production-ready|production grade|enterprise-grade|
state-of-the-art|world-class|best-in-class|breakthrough|revolutionary|
fully verified|fully validated|100% reproducible|guaranteed|
scientifically proven|mathematically proven|battle-tested|
deployment-ready|industry-grade
```

| Metric | Count |
|---|---:|
| Hits across `.md` (excluding venv/worktrees/node_modules/vendor/newsfragments) | **133** |
| Distinct files affected | **25** |
| Strict-violation phrases in zero-tolerance set | 6 (3 contextually correct as negation/definition, 3 unjustified) |

### Phase 5 — broken-path scan (sample)

I sampled the path graph of root-level docs (`README.md`, `DELIVERY.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`) for `docs/<file>.md` references. Result: 1 broken path
discovered (`docs/CLAIMS.md` referenced 3× from `DELIVERY.md` while the
actual file lives at the repository root as `CLAIMS.md`). All other
sampled paths resolve correctly.

A repo-wide systematic broken-path scan across 659 docs is recorded
under "Future evidence gates" — it requires careful handling of
relative-path resolution that varies per host directory.

## Major repairs in this snapshot

### Pass 2 — per-file repairs (added 2026-05-05 in the second sweep)

#### 5. `docs/SEROTONIN_PRACTICAL_SUITABILITY_ASSESSMENT.md` (9 hits)
Prepended PROVENANCE block scoping all 9 "PRODUCTION-READY" / "PRODUCTION-GRADE" verdicts as **module-level integration-readiness against the 62-test suite**, explicitly not a claim about live-venue capital safety (L-1 still binds).

#### 6. `docs/SEROTONIN_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` (7 hits)
Same provenance pattern; renamed title from "Implementation Complete" to "Module-Level Implementation Snapshot".

#### 7. `reports/RELEASE_READINESS_REPORT.md` (6 hits)
Prepended PROVENANCE block reframing the 2025-12-07 verdict as historical release-cut classification, not a current 2026-05-05 statement.

#### 8. `reports/COGNITIVE_TECHNICAL_AUDIT_2025_12_08.md` (5 hits)
Same provenance pattern as the two sibling 2025-12-08 reports (already done in Pass 1).

#### 9. `docs/releases/v0.1.0.md` (4 hits)
Prepended PROVENANCE block. Rewrote the "What is GeoSync?" paragraph to scope "production-ready" wording to the v0.1.0 release-cut classification.

#### 10. `docs/P0_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (4 hits)
Prepended PROVENANCE block. Renamed title to "P0 Production-Readiness Scaffolding". Rewrote Executive Summary to scope language as "P0 work-package operational scaffolding".

#### 11. `docs/operations/PROJECT_DEVELOPMENT_STAGE.md` (3 hits)
Prepended PROVENANCE block scoping the 2025-12-11 stage analysis.

#### 12. `docs/operations/СТАН_РОЗВИТКУ_ПРОЄКТУ.md` (3 hits)
Same as above, Ukrainian sibling.

#### 13. `.github/agents/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (3 hits)
Per-line downgrade: "industry-grade" → "following industry documentation-automation patterns"; "production-ready" → "documentation-quality scaffolding"; security-scan claim scoped to "at the time of release (2025-11-18)".

#### 14. `docs/neuromodulators/dopamine.md` (2 hits)
Per-paragraph downgrade: "production-grade neuromodulatory controller" → exact mathematical contract description; status field reworded to "module-level production-scoped (covers controller contract; not a live-venue capital-safety claim)"; "Production-grade numerical safety" → "Numerical-safety scaffolding".

#### 15. `docs/GITHUB_METADATA.md` (2 hits)
Removed "Enterprise-grade" from both Short and Long GitHub-About descriptions; replaced with "Physics-first algorithmic trading research platform"; added explicit L-1 paper-only disclaimer to the Long Description.

#### 16. `docs/adr/0003-principal-architect-security-framework.md` (2 hits)
Per-paragraph downgrade: Problem-Statement reframed as engineering target rather than achieved status; "Customer Trust: Enterprise-grade security posture" → "Institutional security posture as the architecture target"; numerical Risk-Reduction outcome explicitly re-tagged as a measurable target.

#### 17. `core/indicators/README.md` (2 hits)
Per-line downgrade: "production-grade caching" → "filesystem-backed caching with fingerprinting"; "Production-ready Kuramoto order parameter calculator" → "module-level production-scoped, INV-K1..K7 gated".

#### 18. `scripts/README_resilient_data_sync_sh.md` (1 hit)
"production-grade scripting practices" → "defensive scripting practices".

### Catalog of files NOT edited in Pass 2 (already correct in context)

| File | Why left alone |
|---|---|
| `docs/audit/ierd_phase0_findings.md` (15 hits) | This file IS the self-audit catalog of overclaim usage; every hit is a *finding*, not a claim. Editing it would erase the audit trail. |
| `reports/release_readiness.md` (2 hits) | Both hits are in **negation** ("not yet ready for a production-grade release"; "no production-ready UI"). Honest. |
| `docs/governance/IERD-PAI-FPS-UX-001.md` (4 hits) | This is the governance standard that **forbids** misuse of "production-ready"; all 4 hits are in rule-text that explicitly outlaws the language. Editing would break governance. |
| `docs/METRICS_CONTRACT.md` (2 hits) | Both in metric-row table cells with `goal` / `partial` status and honest comments ("Live trading in beta status", "Patterns implemented, not battle-tested at scale"). Honest. |
| `docs/CLAIM_INVENTORY.md` (2 hits) | Quotes claims from `dopamine.md` / `serotonin.md` in a tracked inventory. Now that the source `dopamine.md` is downgraded, the inventory entry becomes accurate by reference; no edit needed in inventory itself. |
| `docs/archive/LEGACY_20241211_MODULE_ORCHESTRATION_SUMMARY.md` (2 hits) | Already opens with a `⚠️ LEGACY DRAFT` banner pointing at current docs. Honest. |
| `docs/adr/0020-ierd-adoption.md` (2 hits) | Both hits are in body-text **describing the external audit's question against the original wording**. Editing would erase the historical record of what the audit attacked. |
| `docs/releases/geosync-reality-validation-cycle-2026-04-27.md` (2 hits) | Both in **negation** ("No 'production-ready' or 'fully verified' claim"). Honest. |
| `docs/requirements/requirements-specification.md` (2 hits) | "guaranteed" used in formal requirement specifications ("FIFO guaranteed", "7+ year retention guaranteed"). These are contracts, not boasts. |

## Pass 1 — initial repairs (4 files, kept for full record)

### Repaired files (4)

#### 1. `README.md`
Changed: badge `invariants-67` → `invariants-87` (line 12).
Reason: registry (`.claude/physics/INVARIANTS.yaml`) and `CLAUDE.md`
header both state 87 invariants; the badge was stale and contradicted
the canonical source. Fix is one identifier; no rewriting of
surrounding prose.

#### 2. `DELIVERY.md`
Changed: 3 occurrences of `docs/CLAIMS.md` → `CLAIMS.md` (lines 77,
128, 228).
Reason: the file lives at repository root, not under `docs/`. Path was
broken; this was an artefact of the same audit author's pre-final
delivery commit and is corrected here.

#### 3. `reports/AUDIT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_2025_12_08.md`
Changed: prepended an explicit **PROVENANCE — READ FIRST** block on
the executive summary.
Reason: the file contains the strongest unsupported overclaim found in
the audit:
> "GeoSync demonstrates **world-class security posture** and
> **groundbreaking technical innovation**. The system is
> **production-ready** with formal safety guarantees unprecedented
> in the trading platform industry."
The provenance block reframes the file as a 2025-12-08 historical
audit-trail artefact whose verdicts predate the 2026-05-05 evidence
boundary and limitation L-1 (paper-trading only).

#### 4. `reports/COMPREHENSIVE_SECURITY_AUDIT_2025_12_08.md`
Changed: same pattern — provenance block prepended at the top of the
Executive Summary, explicitly reframing "Mathematically proven
stability" and "production-ready" wording as historical-aspirational
rather than current claims.

### Strict-violation hits judged contextually correct (kept as-is)

These are not bugs and require no edit:

| File | Phrase | Why correct |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/operations/CANONICAL_OBJECT.md` | "not yet battle-tested" | negation; honest disclaimer |
| `docs/METRICS_CONTRACT.md` | "not battle-tested at scale" | negation in `partial` row |
| `CLAIMS.md` | "Mathematically proven" | definition of the `FACT` tier of the claim ledger, not a project claim |
| `docs/project_level_assessment_2026-05-03.md` | "world-class" | name of Tier-S in the tier-ladder definition, not a project claim |

---

## Catalog of remaining overclaim files (next evidence gate)

These 21 files contain context-dependent overclaim language that should
be reviewed file-by-file by the operator. **They were not bulk-rewritten
in this audit by deliberate choice** — bulk rewriting documentation
without per-file domain review would itself be an unverifiable claim
about meaning preservation, which violates the audit's primary rule
("documentation is not allowed to make the project look better than the
evidence allows").

Per-file review action: read each file; for every hit, choose one of:
`keep` (if context-anchored to a real evidence path), `downgrade`
(replace strong word with the exact observed behavior), `move to
limitations`, `mark as historical/upstream`, or `remove`.

| File | Hits | Suggested first-pass action |
|---|---:|---|
| `docs/audit/ierd_phase0_findings.md` | 15 | enumerates "production-ready" tags in 35 source files — content is itself an audit finding; keep with cross-reference |
| `docs/SEROTONIN_PRACTICAL_SUITABILITY_ASSESSMENT.md` | 9 | downgrade product-claim language to observed behaviors |
| `docs/SEROTONIN_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` | 7 | review whether the title's "COMPLETE" matches scope |
| `reports/RELEASE_READINESS_REPORT.md` | 6 | reframe as snapshot-of-readiness rather than absolute |
| `reports/COMPREHENSIVE_SECURITY_AUDIT_2025_12_08.md` | 5 | provenance block already added; remaining hits are inside the historical body — keep |
| `reports/COGNITIVE_TECHNICAL_AUDIT_2025_12_08.md` | 5 | add same provenance block as 2 sibling 2025-12-08 reports |
| `docs/releases/v0.1.0.md` | 4 | downgrade to scope-bounded |
| `docs/P0_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | 4 | downgrade |
| `docs/governance/IERD-PAI-FPS-UX-001.md` | 4 | most hits are governance template wording; review per row |
| `reports/AUDIT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_2025_12_08.md` | 3 | provenance block already added; remaining hits inside historical body — keep |
| `.github/agents/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | 3 | agent-protocol artefact; review |
| `docs/operations/PROJECT_DEVELOPMENT_STAGE.md` | 3 | review |
| `docs/operations/СТАН_РОЗВИТКУ_ПРОЄКТУ.md` | 3 | Ukrainian sibling of above; review together |
| `reports/release_readiness.md` | 2 | reframe |
| `docs/requirements/requirements-specification.md` | 2 | review |
| `docs/releases/geosync-reality-validation-cycle-2026-04-27.md` | 2 | review |
| `docs/neuromodulators/dopamine.md` | 2 | technical doc — review whether overclaim is in disclaimer or in claim |
| `docs/METRICS_CONTRACT.md` | 2 | already partial-row honest; second hit may be `goal` row |
| `docs/GITHUB_METADATA.md` | 2 | review |
| `docs/CLAIM_INVENTORY.md` | 2 | review |
| `docs/archive/LEGACY_20241211_MODULE_ORCHESTRATION_SUMMARY.md` | 2 | LEGACY file — append provenance disclaimer |
| `docs/adr/0020-ierd-adoption.md`, `0003-principal-architect-security-framework.md` | 2 each | ADRs — review whether wording reflects observed evidence |
| `core/indicators/README.md` | 2 | module README — first-pass downgrade |
| `scripts/README_resilient_data_sync_sh.md` | 1 | review |

## Commands verified in this audit

| Command | Verified status |
|---|---|
| `git status --short` | runs; output matches audit's recorded state |
| `git rev-parse HEAD` | runs; returns `821f020…` |
| `git log --oneline --decorate -n 20` | runs; first line shows `(HEAD -> integration/canonical-2026-05-05, tag: canonical-2026-05-05)` |
| `find … \( -name '*.md' -o -name '*.rst' \) -print` | runs; 659 results |
| Phase-4 `grep` (overclaim) | runs; 133 hits |
| Phase-5 path checks for `README.md`, `DELIVERY.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | runs; broken `docs/CLAIMS.md` flagged and fixed |

## Commands NOT verified

| Command | Reason for non-verification |
|---|---|
| Repo-wide systematic broken-path resolver | requires careful relative-path handling per host directory; recorded as "Future evidence gate". |
| Full pytest sweep | already executed in the prior pre-final session (commit `568722e`); not re-run here as documentation audit must not modify or re-execute test surface. |
| `gh` push / PR / merge flow | blocked by upstream `neuron7x` token has pull-only rights to `neuron7xLab/GeoSync`; not in scope of documentation audit. |

## Claim discipline summary (current snapshot)

| Tier | Where defined | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ANCHORED | `CLAIMS.md` (FACT, MEASURED, DERIVED rows) | tier ladder definition is intact |
| SUPPORTED_HYPOTHESIS | `CLAIMS.md` (HYPOTHESIS row) | retained |
| EXTRAPOLATED | `CLAIMS.md` cross-references `docs/PERFORMANCE_LEDGER.md` | retained |
| SPECULATIVE | covered by `docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` and inline disclaimers in 4 NEURO-THEATER modules (per prior commit `b44f9f6`) | retained |
| REJECTED / removed | none added in this audit; 4 files reframed via provenance disclaimers (no content removed) | conservative |

---

## Style violations not addressed in this audit

The following style guide rules from the audit protocol were **not
enforced repo-wide** in this snapshot, by deliberate choice:

* **Inspirational manifesto language** — present in
  `~/CANONICAL_ARTIFACT_2026_05_05.md` (kept under home directory, not
  in repo). The repo-side language artefacts (e.g., `paper.md` abstract)
  were already neutral.
* **Founder mythology** — none found in repo-tracked docs.
* **Self-congratulation** — present in 21 catalogued files above; their
  per-file action is recorded in the catalog.
* **Unexplained acronyms** — partially addressed in `CLAUDE.md` and
  `DELIVERY.md`; no repo-wide acronym resolution pass was attempted.

---

## Future evidence gates (smallest next checks)

1. **Per-file pass** of the 21-file catalog above. One commit per file or
   per cluster (e.g., 2025-12-08 reports cluster). Each commit must
   record: which phrases changed, why, and what evidence path now
   anchors the surviving wording.
2. **Repo-wide broken-path resolver.** Implement
   `tools/check_doc_paths.py` that walks every `.md`, parses
   markdown link targets, and verifies each path resolves. Wire into
   CI as a non-blocking gate first; promote to blocking after one clean
   run.
3. **Acronym resolver.** Create `docs/glossary.md` enumerating every
   3+-letter token used in 5+ docs without a definition; cross-link
   from each.
4. **Definition pass on semantic-precision terms** (per audit protocol):
   `intelligence`, `cognition`, `consciousness`, `criticality`,
   `metastability`, `γ`, `validation`, `verification`, `falsification`,
   `production`, `benchmark`, `evidence`, `agent`, `architecture`,
   `pipeline`, `framework`, `system`, `kernel`, `substrate`,
   `invariant`, `anchored`. For each term, the glossary must record:
   one-line definition, in-repo example, and the boundary (when the
   term is and is not appropriate).
5. **Module README template enforcement.** Pick the 5 highest-traffic
   modules (`core/kuramoto/`, `core/neuro/`, `geosync/neuroeconomics/`,
   `runtime/cognitive_bridge/`, `runtime/`); rewrite their READMEs
   to the audit's MODULE README TEMPLATE; the rest follow as backlog.
6. **Reusable audit script.** Save the Phase-4 grep set as
   `tools/audit_overclaim.sh` so any operator can re-run this audit
   with one command and diff against this snapshot.
