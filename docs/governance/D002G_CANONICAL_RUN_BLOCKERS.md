# D-002G — Canonical-run blockers (consolidated)

This document consolidates the open blockers that prevent a canonical D-002G run from being launched on the full pre-registration grid. It is the single fail-loud reference for downstream consumers — if any blocker below is OPEN, the canonical D-002G run is NOT allowed.

Anchor: PR `feat/x10r-d002g-p1-implementation`, P1 implementation report `D002G_P1_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`.

## Status: CANONICAL D-002G RUN BLOCKED

The canonical D-002G run is BLOCKED until ALL blockers below are CLOSED. P1 ships infrastructure + adversarial-test scaffolding; it does NOT establish D-002G scientific PASS and does NOT launch a canonical run.

## Blockers

### B1 — Substrate eligibility (M1-INELIGIBLE on 2/3 substrates) — PARTIALLY MITIGATED (M2 edge-weight)

Two of three stock substrates are seed-deterministic at λ=0 by design:

| Substrate id        | M1 eligibility   |
|---------------------|------------------|
| `ricci_flow`        | M1-ELIGIBLE      |
| `block_structured`  | M1-INELIGIBLE    |
| `temporal_coupling` | M1-INELIGIBLE    |

Mechanism M1 cannot apply to a seed-deterministic substrate at λ=0 — the precursor and null cohort produce bit-identical K, which is exactly the pathology M1 was designed to remove. `BitIdenticalNullError` fires fail-closed at the realisation layer.

**Resolution required**: implementation of mechanism **M2 — topology-preserving shuffle**, per `D002G_PREREGISTRATION.yaml §4 fallback policy`. Downstream PR tag: **D-002G-P2/M2**.

Until B1 is CLOSED, canonical D-002G is BLOCKED for `block_structured` and `temporal_coupling`. The canonical run could in principle proceed on `ricci_flow` alone, but the pre-registration scopes the canonical grid to all three substrates; partial coverage is NOT a canonical run.

#### B1.M2 — Mitigation status (PR D-002G-P2/M2, edge-weight shuffle domain)

PR `feat/x10r-d002g-p2-m2-topology-preserving-shuffle` ships the M2 topology-preserving shuffle infrastructure plus its eligibility verifier. The empirical verdicts on the canonical grid (`lambda_value=0.4`, `base_seed=42`, locked salt 211) are:

| Substrate id        | M2 (edge_weight) verdict                       | M1 ∪ M2 admissible? |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `ricci_flow`        | ELIGIBLE_M2                                    | YES (M1 primary, M2 fallback both available) |
| `block_structured`  | INELIGIBLE_M2_DEGENERATE_SHUFFLE_POOL          | NO — canonical run still BLOCKED on this substrate |
| `temporal_coupling` | INELIGIBLE_M2_DEGENERATE_SHUFFLE_POOL          | NO — canonical run still BLOCKED on this substrate |

The `block_structured` and `temporal_coupling` substrates apply a single constant additive lift across their precursor support; the resulting ΔK carries exactly ONE distinct payload value. The M2 edge-weight shuffle is by construction a permutation over the support payload multiset — every permutation of `{v, v, …, v}` is a no-op, and the verifier refuses such cells with `INELIGIBLE_M2_DEGENERATE_SHUFFLE_POOL` fail-closed rather than emit `K_null == K_p` bit-identically.

**Status.** B1 is PARTIALLY MITIGATED — M1 ∪ M2 covers 1/3 substrates (`ricci_flow`). The two constant-payload substrates remain HARD-BLOCKED for the canonical D-002G run. B1 is **NOT** CLOSED.

**Future work**: investigate M2 node-payload and M2 injection-sequence sub-domains (reserved in `M2EligibilityVerdict.shuffle_domain`), OR pre-register a fresh M3 mechanism. Downstream PR tag candidates: **D-002G-P3/M2-node-payload**, **D-002G-P3/M2-injection-sequence**, **D-002G-P3/M3**.

#### B1.P3 — M2 sub-domain extension status (PR D-002G-P3, node-payload + injection-sequence)

PR `feat/x10r-d002g-p3-constant-payload-null-recovery` ships the M2 node-payload and M2 injection-sequence sub-domain verifiers + realisers, plus a full adjudication protocol. The empirical verdicts on the locked prereg grid (`lambda_value=0.4`, `base_seed=42`, `null_seed=12345`) are:

| Substrate id        | M2_NODE_PAYLOAD                              | M2_INJECTION_SEQUENCE                                          |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ricci_flow`        | INELIGIBLE_M2_NODE_PAYLOAD_TOPOLOGY_COUPLED  | INELIGIBLE_M2_INJECTION_SEQUENCE_DEGENERATE                    |
| `block_structured`  | INELIGIBLE_M2_NODE_PAYLOAD_TOPOLOGY_COUPLED  | INELIGIBLE_M2_INJECTION_SEQUENCE_DEGENERATE                    |
| `temporal_coupling` | INELIGIBLE_M2_NODE_PAYLOAD_DEGENERATE_POOL   | INELIGIBLE_M2_INJECTION_SEQUENCE_CONTRACT_VIOLATION            |

Neither sub-domain admits the two constant-payload substrates. Full machine-readable matrix is at `artifacts/d002g/p3/null_domain_verdicts.json`; long-form at `docs/governance/D002G_P3_ELIGIBILITY_MATRIX.md`.

**Status.** B1 remains OPEN — upgraded from `OPEN_PARTIAL` to `OPEN_REQUIRES_M3`. The M1 / M2 admissibility surface is **exhausted** for `block_structured` and `temporal_coupling`. A fresh M3 mechanism family must be pre-registered; the draft pre-registration is `docs/governance/D002G_P3_M3_PREREGISTRATION.md`. Downstream PR tag: **D-002G-M3 implementation**.

#### B1.M3 — Topology-conditioned null mitigation status (PR D-002G-M3, topology-conditioned independent realisation)

PR `feat/x10r-d002g-m3-topology-conditioned-null` ships the M3 topology-conditioned independent-realisation infrastructure: locked marginal set (degree sequence + block-label histogram + spectral radius / N + density), matched-density generator with a locked iteration cap (`M3_GENERATOR_MAX_ITERATIONS=100`), 5-criterion eligibility ladder, RNG salt 523, and pre-declared tolerance band (`tol_marginal=0.05`, `tol_non_degenerate=1e-3`, `tol_density=0.02`, `tol_spectral_radius=0.05`, `tol_degree_wasserstein=0.05`).

The empirical verdicts on the locked prereg grid (`lambda_value=0.4`, `base_seed=42`, `null_seed=12345`, `N ∈ {50, 100, 200}`) are:

| Substrate id        | M3 verdict (per N)                            | M1 ∪ M2 ∪ M3 admissible? |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `ricci_flow`        | ELIGIBLE_M3 (all N)                           | YES (M1 / M2 edge / M3 all available) |
| `block_structured`  | INELIGIBLE_M3_NON_PRECURSOR_SPECIFIC (all N)  | NO — canonical run still BLOCKED on this substrate |
| `temporal_coupling` | INELIGIBLE_M3_NON_PRECURSOR_SPECIFIC (all N)  | NO — canonical run still BLOCKED on this substrate |

The `block_structured` and `temporal_coupling` substrates produce a seed-deterministic precursor lift by construction; their M3 marginal sets are seed-invariant, so the verifier's criterion 3 (`Identifiable from precursor`) refuses the cell fail-closed (0 / 99 adjacent-seed precursor pairs distinct against a required ≥ 50 / 99). This is the honest scientific outcome — M3 has no right to exist on these substrates under the locked pre-registration discipline. A forced ELIGIBLE_M3 would have demanded post-hoc relaxation of the precursor-specificity criterion or the locked tolerances; both are explicitly forbidden by M3 pre-reg §9.1.

Full machine-readable matrix is at `artifacts/d002g/m3/m3_null_domain_verdicts.json`; long-form at `docs/governance/D002G_M3_ELIGIBILITY_MATRIX.md`.

**Status.** B1 remains OPEN — upgraded from `OPEN_REQUIRES_M3` to `OPEN_REQUIRES_M4`. The M1 ∪ M2 ∪ M3 admissibility surface is **exhausted** for `block_structured` and `temporal_coupling`. A fresh M4 mechanism family must be pre-registered; this PR explicitly does NOT pre-register M4 (touching the M3 pre-reg in this PR would constitute a fresh M4 pre-reg by protocol, which is forbidden — the M4 PR must own its own pre-registration document). Downstream PR tag: **D-002G-M4 pre-registration**.

**Canonical-run status (verbatim):** even though M3 lands ELIGIBLE on `ricci_flow`, canonical run authorisation requires B1 closure (all three substrates ELIGIBLE) AND B2 closure / acceptance AND an explicit canonical-run authorisation artefact. NONE of these conjuncts are satisfied by this PR. Canonical D-002G remains BLOCKED.

#### B1.closure — Structural closure under current locked grid

> After PR #681 (M3 topology-conditioned, merge `cced6e60`) returned `INELIGIBLE_M3_NON_PRECURSOR_SPECIFIC` for both `block_structured` and `temporal_coupling`, the M1/M2/M3 mechanism family is exhausted on the locked substrate grid. The bottom-turtle code fact (`research/systemic_risk/d002c_substrates.py:401`) confirms the substrates discard seed by construction. B1 closure under D-002G is therefore STRUCTURALLY BLOCKED; canonical D-002G run remains BLOCKED. See `D002G_STRUCTURAL_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` for the full closure artifact. Resolution requires fresh D-002H pre-registration (scope narrowing OR substrate redesign), NOT an M4 mechanism inside the current D-002G prereg.

### B2 — Phase 0b CI is percentile bootstrap, not BCa — OPEN (limitation)

The Phase 0b verdict-grade CI on the per-seed paired-difference mean is a percentile bootstrap CI (P1-3 Codex review, Path 2 downgrade). True BCa (bias-corrected accelerated) bootstrap CI was advertised in the original implementation docstring + adversarial audit narrative; the implementation always was percentile.

**Resolution path**: this is documented as a LIMITATION rather than a hard block. The Wilcoxon signed-rank gate (non-parametric, in the conjunction) absorbs most of the skew/bounded calibration concern. True BCa is future hardening; it can land in a downstream PR independent of M2.

Canonical D-002G can in principle launch with B2 OPEN provided the limitation is acknowledged in the run report. **For ABSOLUTE certainty on the skew/bounded calibration**, BCa is required.

## Closure preconditions

Before a canonical D-002G run is allowed:

1. **B1 CLOSED** — M2 mechanism implemented, Phase 0a / 0b / 0c verified on all three substrates, eligibility table updated to show 3/3 M1-or-M2 ELIGIBLE.
2. **B2 acknowledged or CLOSED** — either accept the percentile-CI limitation in the run report or replace with BCa.
3. **Locked governance unchanged** — all 8 sha-pinned files in `tests/systemic_risk/test_d002g_locked_governance_untouched.py` still PASS.

When all three preconditions are met, a canonical D-002G run may be launched. The current P1 PR does NOT meet them and does NOT claim D-002G scientific PASS.

## Claim boundary (verbatim)

> The D-002G P1 PR implements infrastructure and adversarial test scaffolding only. It does NOT establish D-002G scientific PASS. Phase 0 test-suite results are INFRASTRUCTURE SMOKE, not canonical Phase 0 verdict. A fresh canonical D-002G run on prereg-scoped substrates is required before any tier-PASS claim, and is BLOCKED on M2 until the substrate-eligibility gap is closed in a downstream D-002G-P2/M2 PR.

## D-002G ↔ D-002H lineage transition

D-002G closed structurally per the artifact above. Future work proceeds under a fresh
pre-registered lineage:

- **D-002H** (this PR opens it): `docs/governance/D002H_PREREGISTRATION.yaml` —
  ricci_flow-only canonical run scope, scoped pre-registration. Locked at the merge
  commit of `docs/x10r-d002h-ricci-flow-scope-prereg`.
- D-002G remains sha-pinned as a negative-result artifact; **NO M4 inside D-002G**.
- D-002H authorisation gates A..G live in `D002H_CANONICAL_RUN_AUTHORIZATION_GATES.md`
  and must all PASS before any canonical D-002H run begins.

## D-002H Gate B — ricci_flow M1/M3 eligibility reverification

**Status:** PASS
**Artifact:** `artifacts/d002h/eligibility/d002h_ricci_eligibility.json`
**Schema:** D002H-GATE-B-v1
**Report:** `docs/governance/D002H_GATE_B_REPORT.md`
**Merge anchor:** will pin at this PR's merge sha
**Cells:** 18/18 PASS (3 N × 6 λ; λ=0 cells emit `N/A_M3_REQUIRES_LAMBDA_GT_ZERO`
per the M3 module contract; every λ>0 cell ELIGIBLE_M1 AND ELIGIBLE_M3
with marginal-match report inside locked tolerances)

Per `D002H_CANONICAL_RUN_AUTHORIZATION_GATES.md`, Gate B PASS is necessary
but NOT sufficient for canonical D-002H run authorisation. Gates A, B
closed. Gates C, D, E, F, G remain open. Canonical run remains BLOCKED.

**Schema:** D002H-CANONICAL-GRID-v1
**Report:** `docs/governance/D002H_GATE_C_CANONICAL_GRID.md`

Per `D002H_CANONICAL_RUN_AUTHORIZATION_GATES.md` §C: locked canonical
parameter grid declared as machine-readable artifact + human-readable

Gates A, B, C closed. Gates D, E, F, G remain open. Canonical run
remains BLOCKED until conjunction A ∧ B ∧ C ∧ D ∧ E ∧ F ∧ G.

## D-002H Gate D — forbidden-claim scanner

**Status:** PASS (zero leaks across scanned D-002H surface)
**Artifact:** `artifacts/d002h/scans/d002h_forbidden_claim_scan.json`
**Schema:** D002H-GATE-D-v1
**Report:** `docs/governance/D002H_GATE_D_FORBIDDEN_CLAIM_SCAN.md`

## D-002H Gate F — canonical-run authorisation artifact

**Status:** AUTHORISED (intermediate; Gate G required for absolute final)
**Artifact:** `artifacts/d002h/authorization/d002h_canonical_run_authorisation.json`
**Schema:** D002H-CANONICAL-RUN-AUTHORISATION-v1
**Report:** `docs/governance/D002H_GATE_F_AUTHORIZATION_REPORT.md`

Conjunction A ∧ B ∧ C ∧ D ∧ E ∧ F all certified PASS at the
gate-F-pin shas (5 anchors verified ancestors of main). Gate G is the
final CI lock; canonical run remains BLOCKED until A∧B∧C∧D∧E∧F∧G.

---

## D-002H Gate G — FINAL CI lock (canonical-run authorisation COMPLETE)

**Status:** PASS (TERMINAL — 7-gate conjunction A∧B∧C∧D∧E∧F∧G all PASS)
**Artifact:** `artifacts/d002h/authorization/d002h_canonical_run_final_lock.json`
**Schema:** D002H-GATE-G-v1
**Report:** `docs/governance/D002H_GATE_G_CI_LOCK_REPORT.md`
**Canonical run authorisation:** GRANTED (scoped to ricci_flow only)
**Canonical run execution status:** NOT STARTED

The 7-gate authorisation contract is now CLOSED. A separate
canonical-sweep PR may execute the D-002H ricci_flow sweep downstream.
This authorisation does NOT itself produce scientific results; the
sweep PR's R1/R2/R3/R2-B/NULL_AUDIT verdict is the scientific output.

B1 (D-002G substrate eligibility): STRUCTURALLY CLOSED (negative artifact #682)
B1 (D-002H ricci_flow eligibility): CLOSED via 7-gate conjunction
B2 (Phase 0b percentile vs BCa): KNOWN LIMITATION, carried per D-002G prereg §4
canonical_run_authorized_final: TRUE  ← terminal state achieved

## D-002H R2-B scope clarification

**Status:** RESOLVED — R2-B inherited-but-inapplicable under D-002H
**Document:** `docs/governance/D002H_R2B_INAPPLICABILITY_NOTE.md`
**Resolution rule:** D-002H canonical-run acceptance is the 4-term conjunction R1 ∧ R2 ∧ R3 ∧ NULL_AUDIT (R2-B unevaluable because M6 ∉ D-002H null_mechanisms_allowed).

D-002G acceptance rules byte-exact locked. D-002H prereg byte-exact
locked. This is scope clarification, not contract change. Canonical
run authorisation (Gate G, terminal) remains valid; cell-verdict
computation is now contractually unambiguous.

A future M3-based R2-B analogue would constitute a fresh D-002J
pre-registration.

---

## D-002H canonical-sweep execution (downstream of Gate G + R2-B note)

**Status:** EXECUTED — scientific verdict recorded as a downstream
artifact of the closed 7-gate authorisation conjunction and the R2-B
inapplicability clarification.
**Run ID:** `d002h_ricci_flow_canonical_v1_2026-05-14`
**Authoritative artifact:** `artifacts/d002h/canonical/d002h_canonical_run_verdict.json`
**Report:** `docs/governance/D002H_CANONICAL_RUN_REPORT.md`
**Anchor main SHA:** `ee12a9e6a08e5916109c99eec84796d1e1375cd0`
**Acceptance conjunction:** R1 ∧ R2 ∧ R3 ∧ NULL_AUDIT
(R2-B INAPPLICABLE per `D002H_R2B_INAPPLICABILITY_NOTE.md`).

The canonical sweep executes on the locked 18-cell `ricci_flow` grid
under `M1_INDEPENDENT_SEED` and `M3_TOPOLOGY_CONDITIONED` null
mechanisms (`M6_PLACEBO_COUPLING` is structurally excluded per D-002H
prereg). Whatever the data verdict is — `SYNTHETIC_GATE6_CERTIFIED_D002H_REDESIGN`,
`MARGINAL_PASS_SYNTHETIC_D002H`, `D002H_REDESIGN_INSUFFICIENT_AT_TESTED_BUDGET`,
or `REFUSED_NULL_AUDIT_FAIL_D002H` — that IS the result. Truthful FAIL
is preserved as negative artifact.

## D-002H Lineage CLOSED-AS-REFUSED — ledger entry appended

**Status:** D-002H lineage CLOSED with REFUSED verdict
**Ledger entry:** claim_id=D002H_RICCI_FLOW_SCOPED_REFUSED (new, append-only)
**Canonical-run anchor:** PR #691 sha 250d8069
**Aggregate verdict:** REFUSED via NULL_AUDIT_FAIL (42/54 audited cells FAIL)

D-002C ledger entries 1 and 2 (attempt-1 SUPPORTED, attempt-2 FALSIFIED)
byte-exact preserved. D-002H entry is the 3rd and is NOT an eclipse —
D-002H is a scoped lineage opened after D-002G structural closure (PR #682).

Future legal paths:
- D-002I fresh pre-reg to investigate WHY null audit FAILs on ricci_flow
- D-002H retained as scoped-REFUSED negative artifact

---

## D-002I lineage opened — null-audit failure-mode investigation pre-reg

**Status:** D-002I PRE-REG LOCKED (4 falsifiable hypotheses)
**Parent:** D-002H canonical sweep REFUSED (PR #691, sha `250d8069`)
**Parent null-audit aggregate:** 42 / 54 audited cells FAIL on `ricci_flow` under M1 ∪ M3.
**4 hypotheses:** H_I1 (M1 offset), H_I2 (M3 tolerance), H_I3 (signal magnitude), H_I4 (Bonferroni denominator).

Each hypothesis will be implemented in a separate D-002I-P1/Hn PR.
Each produces a SUPPORTED or REFUTED scoped verdict. NO mechanism
change, NO canonical sweep run. D-002I is investigation, not
validation. D-002H REFUSED remains the truthful canonical verdict;
D-002I does NOT retroactively flip it.

If all 4 hypotheses REFUTED → D-002H REFUSED is structural at the
tested signal magnitude on `ricci_flow` under M1 ∪ M3 (mechanism
families M1+M3 fundamentally insufficient at this signal strength);
next step = fresh D-002J pre-reg or retain D-002H as terminal scoped
negative artifact.

D-002J opens a **fresh research lineage** on financially motivated

D-002J-P1A is the first verification gate of the D-002J Frontier
Benchmark Program. P1A audits the 25 sources committed by PR #695
against ten verification dimensions (provider, official URL,
documentation, access method, license boundary, coverage, frequency,
variables, crisis-window relevance, mechanistic relevance). The
audit verdict is **`SOURCE_REGISTRY_REJECTED`** because the
`information_constraint` mechanism family has only one source
(ALFRED, PARTIAL) and the floor of ≥2 verified/partial-per-family is
not satisfied. Rejection is a scientifically valid outcome — the
audit system working as designed.

**DAG state:**

- Nodes: 5 (`D002J-P0`, `D002J-P1`, `D002J-P1A`, `D002J-P1B`, `D002J-P2`).
- Topological order: `D002J-P0 → D002J-P1 → D002J-P1A → D002J-P1B → D002J-P2`.
- Acyclic: `true`. Orphans: `0`.
- Retained rejected nodes: `["D002J-P1A"]` (`TERMINAL_REJECTED`,
  `failure_retention` non-empty, repaired by `D002J-P1B`).
- `D002J-P2.parent_nodes == ["D002J-P1B"]` — P2 depends on the
  repaired registry, NOT on P1A directly.
- `canonical_run_authorized_anywhere`: `false` (every capsule
  carries a `claim_boundary` encoding the no-canonical-run
  invariant; the DAG verdict records the conjunction explicitly).
- DAG self-verdict node: `D002J-P2.5` (`VERDICT_DAG_BOOTSTRAPPED`,

D-002J-P2.5 ships the **verdict DAG self-anchor** under governance

## D-002J-P3 — ingestion manifest + point-in-time adapter boundary landed

**Status:** D-002J-P3 LANDED (ingestion CONTRACT only; no bytes ingested; no canonical run authorisation)
**Parent:** D-002J-P2 (PR #699) CRISIS_WINDOW_REGISTRY_READY at merge sha `055783785571f68a4e0b07206e08c72a8c928e7c` (DAG-anchored via P2.5)
**Decision:** `INGESTION_MANIFEST_READY` (`TERMINAL_PASS`)

**Coverage at PR emit time:**
- `total_adapters` = 18 (floor: 12)
- `by_class`: `static_csv_adapter`=3, `official_api_adapter`=10, `metadata_only_adapter`=2, `literature_reference_adapter`=2, `manual_event_registry_adapter`=1
- `by_status`: `STUB_ONLY`=14, `REQUIRES_MANUAL_DOWNLOAD`=2, `REQUIRES_LICENSE_REVIEW`=2 (NO adapter promoted to `READY` — honest baseline)
- `vintage_aware_count` = 3 (ALFRED GDP + UNEMP, PHILLY_FED_RTDSM GDP) — floor 1
- `forecast_count` = 1 (FRED MICH Michigan consumer inflation expectations) — floor 1
- `BIS/ECB/OFR-bound` = 5 (floor 3)
- `macro_financial-bound` = 7 (floor 6)

**Phase-coupling verified:**
- Every adapter `source_id` is in the P1B audit-surviving set (audit_status ∈ {VERIFIED, PARTIAL}).
- Every adapter `window_id` is declared in the P2 crisis window registry.
- Parent P1B registry sha pinned in manifest: `f1899b7a882b4b3efbebb54e3dc942c079839f77f981273e2dd09757973b14ec`.

**Point-in-time discipline made EXECUTABLE:**
- `test_revisable_sources_require_vintage_adapter` enforces every P1B source whose `mechanistic_relevance` contains `real_time_information_constraint` or `vintage_anti_leakage_baseline` is bound by at least one `vintage_required: true` adapter declaring `vintage_release_date <= decision_date` as a lookahead invariant.
- `test_forecast_sources_require_forecast_date_field` enforces every `forecast_required: true` adapter declares a non-null `forecast_date_field`.
- `test_observation_date_lte_decision_date_invariant` + `test_release_date_lte_decision_date_invariant` enforce the universal baselines.

**DAG verdict (regenerated):**

## D-002J-P4 — Planted Positive Controls v1 (this PR)

Decision: **POSITIVE_CONTROLS_READY**. Status: `TERMINAL_PASS`. Parent: `D002J-P3`.

**Six synthetic positive-control families, each with a paired negative sibling:**

| Control | Class | Ground truth | pass_threshold | Negative sibling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PC1 | `liquidity_shock` | onset_time, effect_size, propagation_radius, shocked_node | worst-node mean-shift z `>= 5.0` (NULL-CALIBRATED above extreme-value null) | `PC1_NEGATIVE_SIBLING` (ε=0) |
| PC2 | `contagion_cascade` | onset_time, cascade_extent, cascade_speed, defaulted_node | impaired-node fraction `>= 0.30` | `PC2_NEGATIVE_SIBLING` (no default) |
| PC3 | `balance_sheet_impairment` | onset_time, mark_down_magnitude, impaired_set | worst-decile capital shift `>= 1.5` | `PC3_NEGATIVE_SIBLING` (no mark-down) |
| PC4 | `volatility_regime_switch` | switch_time, vol_ratio, pre_vol, post_vol | post/pre realised-vol ratio `>= 2.0` | `PC4_NEGATIVE_SIBLING` (stationary var) |
| PC5 | `information_delay_trap` | leakage_delta, expected_failure_mode=LOOKAHEAD_DETECTED | INVERTED: leakage-detection flag `== 1.0` | `PC5_NEGATIVE_SIBLING` (point-in-time correct) |
| PC6 | `official_response_event_shock` | intervention_time, shift_magnitude, pre_vol, post_vol | pre/post vol drop ratio `>= 1.5` | `PC6_NEGATIVE_SIBLING` (no intervention) |

**Verification at PR emit time (8-seed battery {42,7,123,999,2026,1,55,314}):**
- All 6 families: `min(score(signal)) >= pass_threshold` AND `max(score(null)) < pass_threshold`.
- No negative sibling scores at or above its pass_threshold (no FALSE_POSITIVE; no threshold loosened — PC1's bar was RAISED above the null extreme; PC2/PC3 observables were redesigned to be null-bounded).
- PC5 inverted-pass: leakage array scored `1.0` (lookahead caught), point-in-time null scored `0.0` (not flagged) for every seed — P3 point-in-time discipline is EXECUTABLE on the P4 pipeline.
- Determinism: same seed → bit-identical `signal_array` and `null_sibling_array` for all 6 families.

**Scope boundary (repeat for safety):**
- D-002J-P4 is **SYNTHETIC ONLY**. No real data referenced; no file reads from `artifacts/d002j/ingestion/` or anywhere else.
- D-002J-P4 does **NOT** prove real-world performance, bank-level validation, or systemic-risk prediction.
- D-002J-P4 does **NOT** implement the P5 substrate, execute a P6 null, or authorise any P8 canonical run. `canonical_run_authorized_anywhere: false` preserved.
- D-002J-P4 does **NOT** rescue D-002H. D-002H REFUSED remains the truthful canonical verdict.
- D-002J-P4 does **NOT** edit the D-002J prereg (sha256 byte-exact `f3dc65b7e64b96eafe6f23ca8bdd0e05dc9bf95b12c2658b227bd0340f7975a0`) or any locked governance file.
- The ONLY new file under `research/systemic_risk/` is `d002j_positive_controls.py` (P4 is explicitly allowed to add this single implementation file; all other `research/systemic_risk/*` paths are forbidden by the P4 acceptor).

**DAG verdict (regenerated):** `nodes_count` = 7 (was 6); `topological_order` appended `D002J-P4`; `next_legal_nodes_from_main_head` = `["D002J-P5"]`; `acyclic` = true; `orphans` = `[]`; `canonical_run_authorized_anywhere` = false; `dag_self_verdict.node_id` = `D002J-P2.5` (unchanged self-anchor); six locked governance shas byte-exact.

---

## D-002J-P5 — Financial-Mechanistic Substrate Candidates v1 (this PR)

Decision: **SUBSTRATE_CANDIDATES_READY**. Status: `TERMINAL_PASS`. Parent: `D002J-P4`.

**Exactly 3 admitted substrates (operator-locked: not 2, not 4):**

| Substrate | Class | Sources (P1B) | Windows | PC analogue | Required P6 nulls (fwd-decl) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `funding_liquidity_rollover` | funding/liquidity | NYFED_SOFR (V), OFR_REPO_DATA (V), FED_H15 (V) | CW3, CW4, CW5 | PC1 | `phase_shuffled_funding_rate_null`, `block_bootstrap_rollover_null` |

| `volatility_credit_spread_regime` | market/info | CBOE_VIX (P), STLFSI (V), OFR_FSI (V) | CW1, CW4 | PC4 | `single_regime_constant_variance_null`, `iid_shuffled_spread_null` |

**Selection criterion (operator-locked, encoded in manifest):** EXACTLY 3 substrates; ≥1 contagion-class (PC2/PC3); ≥1 funding/liquidity-class (PC1); ≥1 market/information-class (PC4/PC5); collectively cover ≥4 of 6 P2 windows (achieved: **6/6**); NO substrate may require real interbank transaction microdata.

**Brunetti e-MID scope guard (EXECUTABLE):** the physical interbank funding network CONTRACTS in crisis while cross-asset correlation networks EXPAND; therefore cross-asset coherence does NOT prove interbank funding contagion. Every substrate's metadata flags `requires_real_interbank_transaction_data: false` (asserted by `test_no_substrate_requires_real_interbank_transaction_data`), and `test_cross_asset_interbank_distinction_documented` fails on any `cross-asset … interbank … (proves|validates|confirms)` sequence outside the negated declaration blocks.

**Scope boundary (repeat for safety):**
- D-002J-P5 substrates are **GENERATIVE models**, NOT real-data fits. Calibration is P7+ territory.
- D-002J-P5 does **NOT** implement nulls (P6), compute power (P7), run canonically (P8), or edit the D-002J prereg (sha256 byte-exact `f3dc65b7e64b96eafe6f23ca8bdd0e05dc9bf95b12c2658b227bd0340f7975a0`).

- D-002J-P5 does **NOT** rescue D-002H. D-002H REFUSED remains the truthful canonical verdict.
- The ONLY new source files under `research/systemic_risk/` are under `research/systemic_risk/substrates/d002j/` (P5 is explicitly allowed to add this subtree; all other `research/systemic_risk/*` paths are forbidden by the P5 acceptor).

---

## D-002J-P6 — Null Model Hierarchy v1 (this PR)

Decision: **NULL_HIERARCHY_READY**. Status: `TERMINAL_PASS`. Parent: `D002J-P5`.

**Exactly 10 null families (each a FALSIFIER targeting ONE named false explanation; a null with no genuine target is decorative and REJECTED):**

| Null | Class | Target false explanation (abbrev.) | Preserves → Destroys | H_I2-cond |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| N1 `label_permutation` | outcome_alignment | "any structure attached, not THIS outcome-aligned structure" | label multiset → label position alignment | no |
| N2 `time_window_shift_placebo` | temporal_alignment | "just a window-alignment artifact" | marginal dist → window-onset alignment | no |
| N3 `temporal_block_bootstrap` | temporal_dependence | "just iid noise" | lag-1 autocorr band → global trajectory order | no |
| N4 `iaaft_surrogate` | spectral | "linear-spectral artifact only" | spectrum band + amplitude dist → nonlinear phase | no |
| N5 `degree_preserving_graph_null` | graph_degree | "just the degree distribution, not edge placement" | degree sequence (EXACT) → edge placement | no |
| N6 `weight_preserving_shuffle` | graph_weight | "weight magnitude only, not placement" | weight multiset + binary topology → weight placement | no |
| N7 `configuration_model` | graph_topology_conditioned | "generic to any graph with this degree sequence" | degree sequence (EXACT) → specific edge structure | **YES** |
| N8 `sparse_maximum_entropy_reconstruction` | graph_topology_conditioned | "dense-network artifact" | total edge count → dense placement | **YES** |
| N9 `shock_time_placebo` | temporal_alignment | "exists at any time, not the crisis time" | series values + single onset → crisis-time alignment | no |
| N10 `vintage_leakage_trap_null` | leakage_trap | "look-ahead / vintage leakage artifact" | present-arm marginal → causal-information boundary | no |

**N10 INVERTED PASS SEMANTICS:** PASS iff the signal DISAPPEARS in the leakage-free (causal) arm; a signal that persists only in the look-ahead arm is a leakage artifact. This is the P3 leakage-sentinel / PC5 bridge null.

**Substrate → null applicability matrix (3 P5 substrates × 10 nulls), `A`=applicable:**

| Null | funding_liquidity_rollover | cross_exposure_contagion_proxy | volatility_credit_spread_regime |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | A | A | A |
| N2 | A | – | A |
| N3 | A | – | A |
| N4 | A | – | A |
| N5 | – | A | – |
| N6 | – | A | – |
| N7 | – | A | – |
| N8 | – | A | – |
| N9 | A | A | A |
| N10 | A | A | A |
| **count** | **6** | **7** | **6** |

**Phase-coupling P6→P5 (verified):** every P5 substrate binds ≥2 applicable nulls (min = 6); no null lists a non-existent substrate. The two time-series substrates honestly do NOT bind the graph nulls (N5/N6/N7/N8 — no graph to rewire); the contagion substrate honestly does NOT bind the scalar-series nulls (N2/N3/N4 — its observable is a network-cascade quantity). No null is padded onto an inapplicable substrate.

**H_I2 conditional (stim #3, forward-declared, NOT a blocker):** D-002I H_I2 (M3 topology-conditioned over-fit) is UNKNOWN. N7 `configuration_model` and N8 `sparse_maximum_entropy_reconstruction` carry `h_i2_conditional: true` + the note "If D-002I H_I2 is later SUPPORTED, this null requires fresh admissibility justification before canonical use (P8)." The conditional only gates their *canonical* use at P8 and only fires on an H_I2 UNKNOWN→SUPPORTED transition.

**Preserve/destroy verified IN CODE:** every `NullInstance` records `preserved_invariants_checked` and `destroyed_structure_checked` as in-code numeric boolean maps; `.admitted` is `True` only if every preserve AND destroy check passed (e.g. N5/N7 assert the post-rewire degree sequence is *exactly* equal to the pre-rewire degree sequence). Determinism: every null seed→bit-identical `nulled_array`.

**Scope boundary (repeat for safety):**
- D-002J-P6 builds the null-generator HIERARCHY contract + deterministic generators. It does **NOT** execute nulls against real substrate data at scale (P7/P8 territory).
- D-002J-P6 does **NOT** compute power (P7), run canonically (P8), or edit the D-002J prereg (sha256 byte-exact `f3dc65b7e64b96eafe6f23ca8bdd0e05dc9bf95b12c2658b227bd0340f7975a0`).
