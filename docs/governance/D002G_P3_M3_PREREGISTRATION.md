## 1. Background

P3 found that **no M1 / M2-edge-weight / M2-node-payload /
M2-injection-sequence sub-domain admits the `block_structured` or
`temporal_coupling` substrates** on the locked prereg grid.
Eligibility surface is exhausted. Either:

* the canonical D-002G run scope must be narrowed to
  `ricci_flow`-only (NOT permitted: prereg scopes 3 substrates), OR
* a fresh M3 mechanism family must be pre-registered (this doc).

## 2. M3 mechanism family — proposed scope

Working title: **M3 — topology-conditioned independent realisation
under matched-density resampling**.

Core idea: instead of permuting payload values WITHIN a fixed
substrate realisation (the M2 contract), M3 constructs the null
cohort by drawing an INDEPENDENT realisation from a TOPOLOGY-MATCHED
generator whose marginals match the precursor's marginals at the
canonical injection slice.

Concretely (sketch — to be refined by the implementation PR):

```
M3.realize_null(substrate, base_seed, null_seed, λ, N):
    K_p = substrate.realize(N, λ, base_seed).K_precursor[t_inj]
    # Match: degree sequence, block label histogram, spectral
    # radius / N, density. NOT: pointwise payload values.
    K_null = topology_matched_resample(K_p, null_seed)
    return K_null with stamped provenance
```

The match-set is what distinguishes M3 from M1: M1 draws an
independent realisation at λ AND propagates the precursor injection
on a fresh seed; M3 draws an independent realisation conditioned
on the SAME topology summary as the precursor's K_precursor[t_inj]
(no precursor propagation — the conditioning IS the topology
constraint).

## 3. Admissibility criteria

A substrate is M3-ADMISSIBLE iff:

| Criterion | Concrete test |
|---|---|
| **Topology marginal extractable** | Substrate exposes degree sequence / block-label histogram / spectral radius / density from its `SubstrateRealization`. |
| **Matched generator exists** | There is a deterministic-RNG-seedable generator that emits a (T, N, N) K matching the marginals to within `tol_marginal`. |
| **Identifiable from precursor** | The matched marginals are PRECURSOR-SPECIFIC: a different precursor seed yields different marginals at probability ≥ 0.5 over an ensemble of 100 seeds. |
| **Non-degenerate distance** | `||K_null − K_p||_F > tol_non_degenerate` at locked tolerance. |
| **Topology-coupling decoupled** | A non-identity node-permutation of K_null preserves the marginal histogram (this is the M3 invariant — necessary, not sufficient). |

If any of the five fails, M3 is INELIGIBLE for that substrate and
M4 is required.

## 4. Expected invariants

| Invariant | Description |
|---|---|
| **M3-INV-1** | `np.random.default_rng(deterministic_mix(base_seed, M3_SALT))` for all RNG use. No global state. No time-based seeds. |
| **M3-INV-2** | Marginal-match preserved to within `tol_marginal` (degree-sequence Wasserstein, density relative-error, spectral radius / N relative-error). |
| **M3-INV-3** | `K_null` is float64, symmetric, finite, shape `(T_HORIZON, N, N)`. |
| **M3-INV-4** | Same `(base_seed, null_seed, λ, N, substrate.id)` → bit-identical `K_null` and bit-identical `payload_sha256`. |
| **M3-INV-5** | Different `null_seed` (fixed `base_seed`) → different `K_null` for non-degenerate cells. |
| **M3-INV-6** | M3 verifier emits exactly one verdict literal from a locked Literal enum (analogous to `M2EligibilityStatus`). |
| **M3-INV-7** | Failure ⇒ fail-closed; no silent downgrade to M2 / M1 / no-op. |
| **M3-INV-8** | Locked governance unchanged (8-file sha256 pin, including D002C_CLAIM_LEDGER.yaml). |

## 5. Failure states

Locked enum candidates (to be finalised by the implementation PR):

* `ELIGIBLE_M3`
* `INELIGIBLE_M3_MARGINAL_MISMATCH`
* `INELIGIBLE_M3_NON_PRECURSOR_SPECIFIC`
* `INELIGIBLE_M3_DEGENERATE_DISTANCE`
* `INELIGIBLE_M3_GENERATOR_DIVERGENT`
* `INDETERMINATE_M3_PROVENANCE_MISSING`

## 6. Negative controls (mandatory)

The M3 implementation PR MUST ship at least the following negative
controls; xfail with `reason=` is permitted only with a forward
pointer to the PR that resolves them:

1. **NC-M3-1**: a synthetic substrate whose marginals are
   IDENTICAL to its baseline (precursor null) must yield
   `INELIGIBLE_M3_NON_PRECURSOR_SPECIFIC`. The matched generator
   cannot distinguish precursor from null.
2. **NC-M3-2**: a synthetic substrate whose marginals are
   IMPOSSIBLE to match (e.g. fractional degree sequence) must yield
   `INELIGIBLE_M3_GENERATOR_DIVERGENT`.
3. **NC-M3-3**: a substrate whose marginals match but whose K_null
   == K_p bit-identically must yield
   `INELIGIBLE_M3_DEGENERATE_DISTANCE`.
4. **NC-M3-4**: a substrate that raises during `realize()` must
   yield `INDETERMINATE_M3_PROVENANCE_MISSING`.

## 7. Forbidden interpretations

Even when an M3 implementation lands and emits `ELIGIBLE_M3` for
both currently-blocked substrates, that PR may NOT:

* declare D-002G scientific PASS (requires canonical sweep +
  Phase 0a/0b/0c verdicts + locked-governance pin pass);
* mutate `D002C_CLAIM_LEDGER.yaml`;
* close B2 (the percentile-CI limitation);
* authorise a canonical run (requires explicit authorisation
  artefact as per `D002G_P3_NULL_DOMAIN_CONTRACTS.md §7`).

## 8. Review checklist for the future M3 implementation PR

The PR that lands M3 MUST clear all of the following before merge:

- [ ] M3 enum literal added to `M2EligibilityStatus` (or a new
      `M3EligibilityStatus`) without removing existing literals.
- [ ] M3 verifier + realiser implemented with the locked salt
      (e.g. `M3_TOPOLOGY_CONDITIONED_SALT: Final[int] = 523` —
      distinct prime from 211/313/419/99).
- [ ] At least 30 tests: 6 verdict-ladder, 8 invariants (M3-INV-1
      through M3-INV-8), 4 negative controls, 8 adversarial traps,
      plus dispatch & salt-distinctness.
- [ ] `D002G_M3_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` shipped.
- [ ] Eligibility matrix updated to cover M3 column.
- [ ] BLOCKERS.md §B1.M3 subsection appended.
- [ ] Locked governance sha256 pin still PASS (this PR's anchor
      shas are byte-exact unchanged).
- [ ] No D-002G PASS claim string, no D-002C ledger touch, no
      canonical run artifact, no B2 closure claim.

## 9. Pre-registration lock

M3 pre-registration is locked at the merge commit of this PR
(`feat/x10r-d002g-p3-constant-payload-null-recovery`). Any
subsequent edit to this document constitutes a fresh M4
pre-registration. The locked salt for M3 RNG mixing is reserved
(523) but not yet implemented; reservation is recorded here so a
future PR cannot accidentally pick it for an unrelated mechanism.
