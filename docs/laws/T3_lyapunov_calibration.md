# GeoSync Physics Law T3 — Coupling Calibration to a Target λ_1

**Status:** ACTIVE • **Tier:** ANCHORED on Pyragas (1992); Brent (1973)
**Module:** `core/kuramoto/lyapunov_calibration.py`
**Tests:** `tests/unit/physics/test_T3_lyapunov_calibration.py`
**Depends on:** Law T1 (`kuramoto_ricci_rhs`), Law T2 (`lyapunov_spectrum`)

---

## 1. Statement

For a fixed Kuramoto-Ricci network `(ω, A_κ)` and a requested maximal Lyapunov exponent `λ_target`, find

```
K*  =  argmin_{K ∈ [K_min, K_max]}  |λ_1(K · A_κ; ω)  −  λ_target|²,
```

where `λ_1` is the leading exponent computed by Law T2 from the variational flow of `kuramoto_ricci_rhs(ω, K · A_κ)`.

**Why one scalar, not a vector.** The Kuramoto-Ricci kernel has exactly one tunable scalar (`K`) that monotonically scales the spectral profile while preserving topology and the intrinsic-frequency distribution. Calibrating *all* of `(K, ω, κ)` jointly is **not** a well-posed inverse problem — multiple parameter vectors produce identical `λ_1` (e.g. in the supercritical regime `λ_1 ≈ 0` is achieved across a broad K-range). T3 ships only the well-posed slice; the joint inverse is rejected by design.

**Why gradient-free.** SciPy's bounded Brent minimiser converges in ~10–30 evaluations on a smooth 1-D objective. Backpropagating through a 4 000-step `fori_loop` of Jacobians via `jax.grad` is technically possible but wasteful for a 1-D search.

## 2. Algorithm

1. Validate contracts (positivity, shapes, finiteness). Fail-closed on any violation.
2. Define the closure `objective(K) = (λ_1(K · A; ω) − λ_target)²`.
3. Call `scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar(objective, bounds=(K_min, K_max), method='bounded')`.
4. Re-evaluate `λ_1(K*)` to obtain the achieved exponent.
5. If `|λ_achieved − λ_target| ≤ tolerance` → `CONVERGED`; else → `INFEASIBLE`.
6. Return `CalibrationReport(status, K_optimal, lambda_achieved, residual, n_evaluations)`.

The optimiser is deterministic (Brent's method on the same objective evaluates the same points), so identical inputs yield bit-identical `K*` (INV-HPC1 compatibility).

## 3. Constitutional Invariants (P0)

```
INV-CAL1 | algebraic    | feasible target ⇒ residual ≤ tolerance        | P0
                       | (default 5e-2). Round-trip from synthesised
                       | λ via K_truth: residual typically 1e-12.
INV-CAL2 | conditional  | infeasible target ⇒ status INFEASIBLE,        | P0
                       | never silent best-effort. Tested with λ = 5.0
                       | on a small synced graph (physically unreachable).
INV-CAL3 | universal    | K* > 0 always; hard search bound (K_min > 0    | P0
                       | enforced), no soft penalty. Every contract
                       | violation raises ValueError; fail-closed.
```

## 4. Public surface

| Symbol | Role |
|---|---|
| `CalibrationStatus` | Enum: `CONVERGED` or `INFEASIBLE` |
| `CalibrationReport` | NamedTuple: `status`, `K_optimal`, `lambda_achieved`, `residual`, `n_evaluations` |
| `calibrate_coupling_to_lambda(...)` | The calibration entry point |

## 5. Falsification battery (15 tests, 100 % green)

| Test | What it catches if it fires |
|---|---|
| `test_INV_CAL1_recovers_known_K_for_synthetic_target` | Residual exceeds tolerance on a known-feasible target |
| `test_INV_CAL2_infeasible_target_returns_infeasible` | INFEASIBLE not raised on impossible target |
| `test_INV_CAL3_K_optimal_strictly_positive_on_negative_target` | Positivity bound bypassed |
| `test_INV_CAL3_fail_closed_on_contract_violation` (8 parametrised) | Silent input repair |
| `test_INV_CAL3_rejects_signed_adjacency` | Negative κ slips through |
| `test_INV_CAL3_rejects_shape_mismatch` | (ω, A) dimension mismatch silently accepted |
| `test_INV_HPC1_calibration_repeatable` | K* not bit-equal across two identical runs |
| `test_negative_control_K_search_does_not_clamp_to_K_min` | Optimiser silently clamping to K_min on every target — proves the calibration is not vacuous |

The negative control is essential: if the optimiser had a sign bug and always returned `K_min`, every CONVERGED status would still pass INV-CAL1 vacuously. The control asks for two distinct feasible targets and asserts the K* values differ.

## 6. Industrial acceptance conditions

T3 is a law (not a feature) when **all six** are true:

1. ✅ Composes T1 + T2 cleanly; no duplicate physics; no shadow optimisers.
2. ✅ `mypy --strict --follow-imports=silent` clean; `ruff` clean; `black --check` clean.
3. ✅ All 15 falsification tests pass; negative control proves convergence is non-vacuous.
4. ✅ Determinism (INV-HPC1) verified; SciPy + JAX combination is reproducible.
5. ✅ Acceptor YAML recorded; this report path published; INVARIANT REGISTRY updated.
6. ⏳ INVENTORY-hash and module-routing in `CLAUDE.md` updated (administered at PR merge).

## 7. Use in the stack

* Provides the operational answer to "what `K` do I need so that the regime achieves a target Lyapunov profile?" — the GeoSync layer-0/4 control knob is now physically calibrated, not magic.
* T7 (pinning control) will use a CONVERGED `K*` as the prerequisite coupling before activating pinning gains.
* Any production change to `K` in a Ricci-weighted ensemble flows through T3 and emits a `CalibrationReport` artefact (status, residual). No CalibrationReport, no production change.
